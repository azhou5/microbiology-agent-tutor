# CLINICAL CASE: STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS INFECTION

## PATIENT INFORMATION
**Patient Profile:**

- **Name:** Sarah Thompson
- **Age:** 27
- **Gender:** Female
- **Ethnicity:** Caucasian
- **Occupation:** Nurse at a local hospital

**Medical History:**

- Sarah is generally healthy but has a history of atopic dermatitis, which has required intermittent topical steroid treatment.
- No history of diabetes or renal disease.
- No surgical history.

**Risk Factors Specific to Staphylococcus aureus Infection:**

- Persistent carrier of Staphylococcus aureus as confirmed by nasal swab culture during occupational health screening.
- Frequent exposure to hospital environments and patients due to her occupation as a nurse, increasing the likelihood of both nosocomial exposure and hand-to-nose transmission.

**Current Medications:**

- Occasional topical hydrocortisone cream for dermatitis flare-ups.
- No prescribed systemic antibiotics or chronic medications.

**Social History:**

- Non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally.
- Regular gym attendee but ensures wiping down equipment before and after use.
- Resides alone in a well-maintained apartment.
- An active social life, including regular team sports participation, which may lead to minor skin injuries and an increased chance of skin infections.

**Clinical Presentation:**

- Sarah presents with a swollen, painful, and erythematous area on her right forearm. The lesion developed over the past three days and is accompanied by low-grade fever.
- Physical examination reveals a 4 cm area of fluctuance consistent with an abscess.
- Vital signs are otherwise stable, and no systemic signs of severe infection are noted.

The subtle but critical diagnostic clue in Sarah's case is her status as a persistent nasal carrier of Staphylococcus aureus, which, combined with her occupational exposure and underlying dermatitis, raises suspicion for a S. aureus skin infection. This highlights the importance of screening for nasal carriage in healthcare workers and managing skin conditions such as dermatitis to prevent secondary infections.

## HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**History of Present Illness:**

Sarah Thompson, a 27-year-old caucasian female nurse, presents with a complaint of a swollen, painful, and erythematous area on her right forearm that has developed over the past three days. She reports the onset of low-grade fever with temperatures ranging from 99.5°F to 100.3°F and occasional chills. The area initially started as a small, tender bump following minor abrasion during her recent gym workout, which she attributes to equipment contact. She has tried warm compresses without relief. Sarah denies any systemic symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or respiratory distress. She has not used any oral antibiotics and has only applied topical hydrocortisone cream sporadically for recurring dermatitis flares.

**Physical Examination:**

- **General Appearance:** Alert and oriented, in mild distress from arm pain, otherwise well-appearing.
- **Vital Signs:**
  - Temperature: 100.1°F
  - Heart Rate: 88 beats per minute
  - Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute
  - Blood Pressure: 118/72 mmHg
  - Oxygen Saturation: 99% on room air

- **Skin:**
  - Right forearm exhibits a 4 cm area of fluctuance and induration with surrounding erythema and heat. Tenderness is notable upon palpation. No surrounding streaking or satellite lesions.
  - No signs of lymphangitis.
  - Chronic eczematous changes noted on elbows and knees, consistent with atopic dermatitis but without acute inflammation.

- **Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat (HEENT):**
  - No nasal congestion, discharge, or lesions. Anterior nares mildly moist with no crusting.
  - Oral cavity without lesions or erythema.

- **Cardiovascular:**
  - No murmurs, gallops, or rubs; regular rate and rhythm.
  
- **Respiratory:**
  - Clear breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezing or rales.

- **Abdomen:**
  - Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly or masses.

- **Musculoskeletal:**
  - Normal range of motion in all joints except the affected forearm due to pain.
  
- **Neurological:**
  - Alert and oriented; no focal deficits.

Sarah's primary presenting complaint aligns with a probable diagnosis of a staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI), likely an abscess, given the fluctuance noted. The combination of her occupational exposure as a nurse, persistent nasal carrier status, and history of atopic dermatitis suggest increased susceptibility to such infections. Suitable management would include incision and drainage as indicated by physical exam and potential systemic antibiotic therapy based on culture results.

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**Diagnostic Studies:**

- **Laboratory Results:**
  - **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
    - White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 12,500/mm³ (Elevated, indicating infection)
    - Hemoglobin: 13.8 g/dL (Normal)
    - Platelets: 250,000/mm³ (Normal)
  
  - **Chemistry Panel:**
    - Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Bicarbonate: Within normal limits
    - Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Creatinine: Normal, indicating normal renal function
  
  - **Inflammatory Markers:**
    - C-Reactive Protein (CRP): 50 mg/L (Elevated, indicative of inflammation)
    - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR): 30 mm/hr (Elevated, supporting the inflammatory response)

- **Microbiology Results:**
  - **Wound Culture:**
    - Gram stain of fluid from the forearm abscess showed numerous gram-positive cocci, arranged predominantly in clusters, consistent with Staphylococcus species.
    - **Culture:** Growth of Staphylococcus aureus confirmed within 24 hours of incubation, with presumption of methicillin resistance pending further analysis.
    - **Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing:** Pending, commonly revealing resistance to methicillin (MRSA) but susceptibility to clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, typical for community-acquired infections.

- **Imaging:**
  - **Ultrasound of the Forearm:**
    - Demonstrated a 4 cm collection consistent with an abscess. No extension into deeper structures, confirming that it remains superficial.

- **Additional Diagnostic Tests:**
  - **Nasal Swab Culture:** Confirms persistent colonization with Staphylococcus aureus.
  - **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):**
    - Rapid detection assays performed for mecA gene confirming methicillin resistance and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes, often present in community-associated MRSA strains.

These diagnostic findings support the clinical impression of a cutaneous Staphylococcus aureus infection, specifically MRSA, which aligns with Sarah’s known nasal carriage status and typical presentation for an abscess. Initiating appropriate surgical drainage and considering empirical antibiotic coverage such as clindamycin or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim would be prudent, guided by susceptibility results once finalized.

## DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT
**Diagnosis:**

The patient, Sarah Thompson, is diagnosed with a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI), specifically a superficial abscess on her right forearm. Risk factors include her persistent carrier status, history of atopic dermatitis, and frequent exposure to hospital settings due to her occupation as a nurse.

**Treatment Plan:**

1. **Surgical Intervention:**
   - **Incision and Drainage:** Immediate incision and drainage of the abscess is recommended to promote healing and prevent further spread of the infection. This is a critical first step in managing localized abscesses.

2. **Antimicrobial Therapy:**
   - **Clindamycin:** 300 mg orally every 6 hours for 7 days if susceptibility testing confirms sensitivity. Clindamycin is often effective against MRSA in community settings and covers potential toxins produced by the bacteria.
   - **Alternatives if needed:** 
     - **Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX):** Double strength (160 mg/800 mg) tablet orally twice daily for 7 days, if clindamycin is inappropriate due to allergy or sensitivity pattern.
     - **Doxycycline:** 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as an alternative with efficacy against MRSA.

3. **Supportive Care:**
   - Pain management with acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed for pain and fever.
   - Continue topical hydrocortisone as needed for management of existing dermatitis, avoiding application over broken skin.

**Prognosis:**

- **Expected Outcome:** With prompt drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy, Sarah is expected to recover fully within 1-2 weeks without significant complications. Her risk of recurrence can be mitigated by managing her nasal carrier state and monitoring her dermatitis.
- **Potential Complications:** Remaining vigilant for signs of cellulitis or systemic spread is crucial, including further fever, increased erythema, or systemic symptoms, which would necessitate reevaluation.

**Follow-Up Recommendations:**

- **Immediate Post-Procedure:** Follow-up within 48 hours to assess wound healing and response to treatment.
- **Continued Monitoring:** Weekly visits until complete resolution of symptoms. Educate on hand hygiene and proper wound care to prevent recurrence.
- **Nasopharyngeal Carrier Suppression:** Consider nasal mupirocin ointment twice daily for 5 days and chlorhexidine washes routinely to reduce nasal carriage and recurrence risk.
- **Lifestyle Modifications:** Encouraging meticulous gym hygiene, including regular equipment cleaning and wearing protective clothing during sporting activities, to minimize skin abrasions and subsequent infections.

This treatment plan is evidence-based and tailored to Sarah, helping to ensure effective management of her MRSA SSTI while addressing the underlying risk factors contributing to her susceptibility.
