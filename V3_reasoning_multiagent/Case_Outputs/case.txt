# CLINICAL CASE: BORRELIA BURGDORFERI INFECTION

## PATIENT INFORMATION
**Patient Profile:**

- **Age and Gender:** 45-year-old male
- **Demographics:** Resides in rural Connecticut, part of the Northeastern US where Lyme disease is endemic. Occupation is a landscape gardener.
- **Significant Medical History:** 
  - No prior history of Lyme disease.
  - Hypertension, controlled with medications.
  - Allergic rhinitis, seasonal.
- **Risk Factors Specific to Borrelia burgdorferi Infection:**
  - Frequent outdoor activity in wooded and grassy areas as part of his job, increasing exposure to ticks.
  - Has a dog that often follows him to work, which could increase ticks in personal living spaces and vicinity.
- **Current Medications:** 
  - Lisinopril for hypertension.
  - Loratadine as needed for allergies.
- **Social History:**
  - Non-smoker and does not consume alcohol.
  - Married, with two school-aged children.
  - Enjoys hiking and camping during weekends, often in local parks.
  
**Clinical Presentation:**
The patient presents with a 10-day history of fatigue, mild headaches, and generalized malaise. He reports noticing a "bull's-eye" rash on his left calf, measuring approximately 10 cm in diameter and slightly warm to the touch, appearing about a week after a weekend hiking trip. The patient recalls removing a tick from the back of his leg approximately two weeks ago but did not think much of it at the time. He denies any recent travel outside of his home region.

**Relevant Diagnostic Clues:**
- Erythema migrans (bull's-eye rash) is a prominent early sign of Lyme disease.
- Epidemiological risk due to residing in an endemic area and occupational exposure.
- The timeline of rash development and fatigue fits the incubation period of Lyme disease.

The constellation of his symptoms and history strongly suggests an early localized Borrelia burgdorferi infection, requiring confirmation through relevant serological testing and prompt antibiotic treatment to prevent progression to more severe sequelae.

## HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**History of Present Illness:**

The patient is a 45-year-old male presenting with a 10-day history of progressive fatigue, mild headaches, and generalized malaise. He describes the headaches as dull, occurring intermittently throughout the day. Approximately seven days ago, he noticed an erythematous rash on his left calf. The rash initially presented as a small red spot but expanded over the week into a larger "bull's-eye" pattern, now measuring approximately 10 cm in diameter. The patient mentions the rash is not painful but is slightly warm to touch. He recalls removing a tick from his leg around two weeks ago but did not experience any immediate symptoms. He denies fever, chills, joint pain, or neck stiffness.

**Relevant Positive Findings:**
- Presence of erythema migrans on the left calf.
- Malaise and fatigue.
- Mild intermittent headaches.

**Relevant Negative Findings:**
- No fever or chills.
- No joint swelling or pain.
- No neck stiffness.
- No recent travel outside of endemic areas.

**Vital Signs:**
- Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
- Heart rate: 78 beats per minute
- Blood pressure: 128/82 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air

**Physical Examination:**

- **General Appearance:** Alert, mildly fatigued, in no acute distress.
- **Skin:** A distinct erythema migrans rash is present on the left calf, approximately 10 cm with central clearing and a red, concentric outer ring; no other rashes or lesions noted.
- **HEENT:** Normocephalic, atraumatic. Eyes: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No conjunctivitis. Ears, nose, and throat: Normal. 
- **Neck:** Supple, no cervical lymphadenopathy, no neck stiffness.
- **Cardiovascular:** Regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
- **Respiratory:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
- **Musculoskeletal:** No joint swelling or tenderness, full range of motion in all joints.
- **Neurological:** Cranial nerves II-XII intact. No motor or sensory deficits, normal gait.
- **Lymphatic:** No palpable lymphadenopathy.

These findings, together with the patient's recent history of tick exposure and rash consistent with erythema migrans, are highly suggestive of early localized Lyme disease due to Borrelia burgdorferi infection. Prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy is indicated to prevent progression to disseminated or late-stage Lyme disease.

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**Diagnostic Studies:**

**Laboratory Tests:**

- **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
  - White Blood Cells: 7,500/mm³ (Normal: 4,500-11,000/mm³)
  - Hemoglobin: 14.5 g/dL (Normal: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
  - Platelets: 250,000/mm³ (Normal: 150,000-450,000/mm³)
  - Interpretation: CBC is within normal limits, indicating no significant hematologic abnormalities.

- **Serological Tests:**
  - **Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for Lyme Disease:** Positive for Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies.
  - **Western Blot:** Positive for Borrelia burgdorferi, with at least five bands indicating IgG response, confirming Lyme disease.

- **Chemistry Panel:**
  - Electrolytes, liver function tests, and renal function tests all within normal limits, indicating no systemic organ involvement at this stage.

- **Inflammatory Markers:**
  - C-Reactive Protein (CRP): Slightly elevated at 1.5 mg/dL (Normal: <1 mg/dL), consistent with mild inflammation.
  - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR): 20 mm/hr (Normal: 0-20 mm/hr), at the upper end of normal range, indicating mild inflammatory process.

**Microbiology:**

- **Borrelia Culture:** Culture not performed as serological tests are more effective at this stage; Borrelia cultures are mainly helpful from erythema migrans biopsies in early localized infection, but seldom performed due to the reliable serology.

**Imaging Studies:**
- Not indicated at this stage, as clinical diagnosis and serology are adequate for diagnosis of Lyme disease due to Borrelia burgdorferi.

**Other Diagnostic Tests:**

- **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):**
  - Not performed for early localized Lyme disease; PCR is more beneficial in detecting B. burgdorferi DNA in joint fluid or CSF in later stages of disease.

These diagnostic findings, particularly the positive serological tests, confirm the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi infection, consistent with Lyme disease. The positive ELISA and Western Blot results, alongside the clinical presentation of erythema migrans and symptoms, strongly support the diagnosis. Prompt initiation of oral antibiotic therapy, generally with doxycycline, is recommended to prevent disease progression.

## DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT
**Diagnosis:**

- **Final Diagnosis:** Early localized Lyme disease due to Borrelia burgdorferi infection, evidenced by erythema migrans on the left calf and positive serological testing (ELISA and Western Blot).

**Treatment:**

Given the patient's clinical presentation of early localized Lyme disease without evidence of neurological or cardiac complications, the following treatment plan is recommended:

- **Antimicrobial Therapy:**
  - **Doxycycline:** 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days. Doxycycline is preferred due to its efficacy in treating early Lyme disease and its coverage for potential co-infections transmitted by ticks, such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum. 
  - **Alternative:** Should the patient have contraindications for doxycycline, such as allergy or intolerance, **Amoxicillin 500 mg orally three times daily for 14 days** may be used as an alternative.

- **Supportive Care:**
  - Continue antihypertensive therapy with Lisinopril. Monitor blood pressure given potential interactions with antibiotics.
  - Use Loratadine as needed for any allergic rhinitis symptoms, ensuring no contraindications with doxycycline.

**Expected Prognosis:**

With appropriate antibiotic therapy, the prognosis for early localized Lyme disease is excellent, with most patients experiencing complete resolution of symptoms. Early treatment minimizes the risk of progression to disseminated Lyme disease or chronic Lyme arthritis.

**Potential Complications:**

Patients with untreated or inadequately treated Lyme disease may develop disseminated disease affecting the nervous system, heart, or joints.

**Follow-up Recommendations:**

- Schedule follow-up appointment in 2-3 weeks to assess treatment efficacy and resolution of symptoms.
- Educate the patient on preventive measures, including appropriate clothing and the use of insect repellents when outdoors, as well as regular tick checks after potential exposures.
- Consider referral to an infectious disease specialist if symptoms persist or new symptoms develop, indicating possible progression to late-stage Lyme disease.
