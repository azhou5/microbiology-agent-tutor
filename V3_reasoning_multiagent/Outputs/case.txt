# CLINICAL CASE: HSV-1 INFECTION

## PATIENT INFORMATION
**Patient Profile:**

- **Age:** 25 years
- **Gender:** Female
- **Demographics:** Caucasian, resides in a mid-sized urban area in the United States.

**Significant Medical History:**

The patient reports no history of significant medical conditions. She has been generally healthy, with occasional respiratory infections, but no chronic illnesses or hospitalizations. There is no family history of autoimmune diseases or significant viral illnesses.

**Risk Factors Specific to HSV-1 Infection:**

She presented with severe gingivostomatitis during her college years, which was treated symptomatically at the time. Recently, she has experienced recurrent herpes labialis (cold sores), particularly during periods of stress or illness. Additionally, she engages in regular orogenital contact with her partner, a possible route for HSV-1 transmission.

**Current Medications:**

Occasional use of acyclovir (400 mg twice daily during outbreaks) with satisfactory results in managing symptoms. Additionally, she takes oral contraceptive pills and daily vitamin D supplements.

**Social History:**

The patient is sexually active with one partner and recognizes the importance of safe sexual practices. She works in a high-pressure marketing job, contributing to stress, which she identifies as a trigger for cold sore outbreaks. She has no history of smoking but consumes alcohol socially. Her living conditions and socioeconomic status are middle-class.

In this case, her orofacial symptoms of HSV-1, history of gingivostomatitis, and recurrent herpes labialis, coupled with the recent onset of genital symptoms following orogenital contact with her partner, are crucial diagnostic clues. An accurate diagnosis of HSV-1 infection can be confirmed through clinical examination and laboratory evidence of HSV-1 presence, considering her history and presentation.

## HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
**History of Present Illness:**

The patient, a 25-year-old Caucasian female, presents with a 4-day history of painful oral lesions and general malaise. She reports the sudden onset of vesicular lesions on her lips and inside her mouth, which have progressively worsened. This episode is accompanied by a sore throat, mild fever, and headache. She has experienced similar lesions previously, but notes that this episode is more painful and widespread. She denies any genital lesions but mentions engaging in recent orogenital contact with her partner. There is no history of difficulty swallowing or breathing, and she denies any vision changes.

**Physical Examination:**

- **Vital Signs:** Temperature: 100.4°F (38°C), Heart Rate: 88 bpm, Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths/min, Blood Pressure: 118/76 mmHg.

- **General Appearance:** The patient appears slightly fatigued but is in no acute distress.

- **Head and Neck:**
  - **Oropharynx:** Multiple vesicular lesions on erythematous bases are present on the vermillion border of the lips and intraoral buccal mucosa. Lesions extend to the hard palate and gingiva. Mild pharyngeal erythema noted without exudate.
  - **Lymph Nodes:** Bilateral tender cervical lymphadenopathy is present.

- **Skin:** No other lesions or rashes are observed elsewhere on the body.

- **Eyes:** Conjunctivae are clear; no lesions or discharge.

- **Respiratory, Cardiovascular, and Abdominal Examination:** Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, regular heart rate and rhythm, and a soft, non-tender abdomen with no hepatosplenomegaly.

- **Neurological Examination:** Alert and oriented, cranial nerves II-XII intact, no focal deficits.

The clinical presentation is consistent with an HSV-1 orofacial manifestation, particularly recurrent herpes labialis and possibly mild HSV pharyngitis. Laboratory confirmation via viral culture or PCR from lesions can further substantiate the diagnosis.

## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
**Diagnostic Studies:**

1. **Laboratory Results:**
   - **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** 
     - White Blood Cell Count: 8,500/mm³ (normal)
     - Hemoglobin: 13.0 g/dL (normal)
     - Platelets: 250,000/mm³ (normal)
   - **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP):**
     - Sodium: 138 mmol/L (normal)
     - Potassium: 4.2 mmol/L (normal)
     - Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL (normal)
     - Glucose: 82 mg/dL (normal)
   - **Inflammatory Markers:**
     - C-reactive Protein (CRP): 8 mg/L (mildly elevated)
     - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR): 15 mm/hr (normal)

2. **Microbiology:**
   - **HSV Culture:** Vesicle swabs are sent for viral culture; HSV-1 is isolated, confirming active infection.
   - **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):** HSV DNA detected from the vesicular lesion, verifying HSV-1 subtype.
   - **Tzanck Smear:** Presence of multinucleated giant cells, indicative of herpes virus infection, though less specific than PCR.

3. **Serology:**
   - **HSV-1 IgM/IgG Serology:** Positive for HSV-1 IgG, consistent with a history of HSV-1 infection; IgM negative, indicating this is likely a recurrence rather than a new primary infection.

4. **Imaging:**
   - No imaging studies are warranted in this case as there are no signs of systemic involvement or complications such as encephalitis or keratitis that require further evaluation.

5. **Additional Tests:**
   - **Vision Assessment:** Given the absence of any visual symptoms or signs of keratitis, routine eye examination does not indicate any HSV-related ocular damage.

These diagnostic studies confirm the clinical suspicion of an HSV-1 orofacial recurrent infection. The culture and PCR results provide definitive evidence of HSV-1, validating the treatment regimen with acyclovir and supporting continued symptom management.

## DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT
**Diagnosis:**

Final Diagnosis: Recurrent HSV-1 infection manifesting as herpes labialis and possible HSV pharyngitis. The infection is limited to the orofacial region without systemic complications.

**Treatment Plan:**

1. **Antiviral Therapy:**
   - **Acyclovir:** Continue with 400 mg orally, taken twice daily during outbreaks for symptom relief. Given the patient's responsiveness to acyclovir and minimal side effects reported in previous episodes, this remains the most appropriate treatment.
   - **Alternative Option:** If the patient desires a more convenient dosing schedule or if adherence is a concern, **Valacyclovir** can be prescribed at 2000 mg orally twice in one day at the first sign of symptomatic recurrence.

2. **Supportive Care:**
   - **Pain Management:** Ensure adequate hydration and consider the use of ibuprofen (400 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for pain) to manage discomfort associated with oral lesions and fever.
   - **Topical Therapy:** Application of topical lidocaine gel to oral lesions for localized pain relief, sparingly used.

3. **Lifestyle Modifications and Preventive Measures:**
   - Recommend stress-reduction techniques, as stress is identified as a trigger for her outbreaks.
   - Counsel on avoiding orogenital contact during active outbreaks to prevent potential transmission.

4. **Follow-Up Recommendations:**
   - Schedule a follow-up in 2 weeks to assess symptom resolution and effectiveness of therapy.
   - Consider serologic testing for her partner to understand their HSV status and guide any further preventive measures.
   - If outbreaks continue to be frequent or severe (more than 6 episodes a year), discuss options for daily suppressive therapy with valacyclovir (500 mg daily) for prolonged prophylaxis.

**Prognosis:**

With the current treatment regimen, the patient is expected to have rapid resolution of symptoms within 7 to 10 days. Herpes labialis commonly recurs, but with effective antiviral therapy and lifestyle modifications, the frequency and severity of episodes can be significantly reduced. Potential complications, like herpetic whitlow or conjunctivitis, are rare but should be monitored through regular check-ups.
