The first member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents, nalidixic 
acid, is a 1,8-naphthyridine structure that was identified by Lesher and 
associates in 1962 as a byproduct of chloroquine synthesis. Oxolinic 
acid and cinoxacin were also developed in the 1970s, but it was the 
identification in the 1980s of the fluorine- and piperazinyl-substituted 
derivatives with substantially greater potency and expanded spectrum 
that enabled expansion of this class of compounds. A broad spectrum 
of activity, good oral absorption, and generally good overall tolerability 
have resulted in extensive clinical use of the newer fluoroquinolones. 
Several quinolones, however, including temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, 
grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin, and gatifloxacin, were removed from clinical 
use after approval because of toxicities, which were uncommon but 
severe in some cases. This chapter focuses on those quinolones that are 
currently in clinical use.
CHEMICAL STRUCTURES
All current quinolone derivatives in clinical use have a dual ring structure 
with a nitrogen at position 1, a carbonyl group at position 4, and a 
carboxyl group attached to the carbon at the 3 position of the first ring 
(Fig. 35.1 ). Several different dual ring structures—cinnoline (nitrogens 
at positions 1 and 2), pyridopyrimidine (nitrogens at positions 1, 6, and 8), and 2-pyridone (a dual ring structure with the nitrogen located 
at the junction of the two rings)—have been developed, but quinolones, 
which themselves have a carbon at position 8 in the second ring, and 
naphthyridines, which contain a nitrogen at position 8, have been most 
widely successful. Both quinolones and naphthyridines, however, are 
commonly referred to as quinolones.
Nalidixic acid is a 1,8-naphthyridine with 1-ethyl and 7-methyl 
substituents (see Fig. 35.1 ). Oxolinic acid (quinolone ring; see Fig. 35.1 ) 
and cinoxacin (cinnoline ring; not shown in Fig. 35.1 ) also have 1-ethyl 
substitutions, as well as a dioxolo ring bridging positions 6 and 7. Potency 
is greatly improved by the addition of a fluorine at position 6, and 
potency against gram-negative bacteria is further enhanced by the 
addition of a piperazinyl (norfloxacin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin), methyl-
piperazinyl (pefloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, temafloxacin, 
levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, gatifloxacin), or dimethyl-piperazinyl 
(sparfloxacin) substituent at position 7.1 Methyl substituents on the 
piperazine ring generally result in improved oral bioavailability. These 
structural features are common to most of the newer quinolone derivatives 
now in clinical use. Pyrrolidinyl (tosufloxacin, clinafloxacin, gemifloxacin) 
or dual ring substituents (trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin) at 
position 7 enhance activity against gram-positive bacteria. Delafloxacin

of the two stereoisomers, and levofloxacin is the more potent of the 
two and predictably is twice as potent as ofloxacin in vitro. At position 
5, replacement of the hydrogen by an amino group (sparfloxacin) or a 
methyl group (grepafloxacin) results in some enhancement of activity 
against gram-positive bacteria. At position 8, addition of a halide 
(chlorine-clinafloxacin, fluorine-sparfloxacin, and sitafloxacin) or a 
methoxy group (gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin) enhances activity against 
anaerobic bacteria. Halides at position 8 increase the risk of phototoxicity, 
but methoxy groups at this position reduce risks of phototoxicity, even 
relative to compounds with a hydrogen at position 8.
Coming full circle in structural modifications, “desfluoro” quinolones 
(garenoxacin) have been identified with excellent and similar potency is distinct because of its anionic 3-hydroxy-1-azetidinyl substituent at 
position 7, which contributes to its increased potency against gram-
positive bacteria and increased activity at low pH. A number of com -
pounds (sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin) use the 
1-cyclopropyl group, which enhances potency, particularly against 
gram-negative bacteria, and was originally identified for ciprofloxacin. 
The 1-difluorophenyl group found in temafloxacin, tosufloxacin, and 
trovafloxacin and the 1-6-amino-3,5-difluoro-2-pyridinyl found in 
delafloxacin add potency against gram-positive bacteria. An additional 
ring structure bridging positions 1 and 8 is found in ofloxacin and 
levofloxacin; the additional ring of ofloxacin contains an asymmetric 
carbon, resulting in stereoisomeric forms. Ofloxacin is a racemic mixture O

Quinolone inhibition of bacterial DNA replication and bacterial 
killing may be dissociated under some conditions, suggesting that events 
in addition to the initial interaction of quinolones with the topoisomerase-
DNA complex may be required for cell killing.23 In particular, inhibitors 
of RNA and protein synthesis reduce the bactericidal activity of some 
quinolones but do not affect their ability to inhibit bacterial DNA 
synthesis.24 Thus inhibition of bacterial DNA synthesis per se is not 
sufficient to account for bacterial killing, and possibly, newly synthesized 
gene products may also be necessary. This effect may account for the 
observations that at high concentrations of quinolones, which also 
secondarily inhibit protein synthesis, cell killing is reduced.5,23
Quinolones, β-lactams, and aminoglycosides have all been shown 
to generate the production of hydroxyl radicals through a proposed 
complex series of events involving stimulation of oxidation of reduced 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide via electron transport, which generates 
superoxide radicals that then damage intracellular thiol-bound iron 
clusters, releasing ferrous iron for oxidation by the Fenton reaction. 
Production of hydroxyl radicals can damage cellular macromolecules 
and contribute to bacterial cell death, thus suggesting one component 
of a common pathway of bacterial lethality for different classes of 
bactericidal antibiotics.25
Eukaryotic cells also contain topoisomerases, and eukaryotic 
topoisomerase II, which is a homodimeric enzyme that is a member 
of the type IIA class of topoisomerases, such as DNA gyrase and 
topoisomerase IV , has a domain structure and limited primary amino-acid 
sequence homology similar to the bacterial enzymes.26–28 Current 
antibacterial quinolones in clinical use have only minimal activity against 
mammalian topoisomerase II,29 but other quinolone structures, containing 
a 7-hydroxyphenyl substituent or an isothiazolo ring bridging positions 
2 and 3, have been shown to have substantially enhanced potency against 
the mammalian enzyme.27
MECHANISMS OF ACQUIRED 
BACTERIAL RESISTANCE
Bacteria acquire resistance to quinolones from spontaneously occurring 
mutations in chromosomal genes that either alter the target enzymes, 
DNA gyrase, and topoisomerase IV , or alter drug permeation across 
the bacterial cell membranes.30,31 Recently, several plasmid-mediated 
quinolone resistance mechanisms have been identified in clinical isolates 
of Enterobacteriaceae. These horizontally acquired genes are generally 
not sufficient alone to confer clinical resistance to fluoroquinolones but 
enable survival under drug exposure and facilitate selection of chro -
mosomal mutations.32 The products of the plasmid-encoded qnr genes 
have been shown to protect DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from 
quinolone action.33,34 A modification of a common plasmid-encoded 
aminoglycoside acetylating enzyme, Aac(6 ′)-Ib-cr, mediates quinolone 
resistance through acetylation of the nitrogen on the piperazinyl substitu -
ent at position 7 of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin.35 Genes encoding 
efflux pumps, such as QepA36,37 and OqxAB,38 that include quinolones 
in their substrate profiles have also been found on plasmids, albeit 
infrequently to date.
Resistant chromosomal mutants may be selected in the laboratory 
by plating bacteria on drug-containing agar. The frequency of occurrence 
of spontaneous mutants differs with the selecting drug concentration 
and the drug. For gram-negative bacteria selected with the newer fluo -
roquinolones, frequencies range, in general, from 10−6 or higher at 
twofold above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to undetect -
able ( <10−10) at 16- to 32-fold above the MIC. With a similar selection 
with nalidixic acid, mutants are detected more frequently when selected 
at a similar factor greater than the MIC because single mutations can 
cause a higher level of increase in resistance ( >30-fold) relative to 
ciprofloxacin (eightfold) and other fluoroquinolones. This difference 
results in part because the magnitude of the increase in resistance 
conferred by a single-target mutation is modified by the interaction of 
drug with the second target enzyme. For example, for nalidixic acid, 
which has little activity against topoisomerase IV , a common mutation 
in the GyrA subunit of DNA gyrase causes a 30-fold increase in the 
MIC. In contrast, for ciprofloxacin, which has activity against topoi -
somerase IV (albeit less than its activity against gyrase), the same gyrA  
gene mutation causes only an eightfold increase in the MIC, despite to their fluorinated counterparts but with possible reductions in joint 
toxicities.2–4
MECHANISM OF ACTION
The quinolones rapidly inhibit bacterial DNA synthesis, an event that 
is followed by rapid bacterial cell death. The molecular events that 
underlie these actions are understood in part, but details remain to be 
defined.5
Quinolones inhibit the enzymatic activities of two members of 
the topoisomerase class of enzymes—DNA gyrase and topoisomerase 
IV—and promote the cleavage of DNA in these enzyme-DNA complexes. 
DNA gyrase, which was the first-recognized target of quinolones, is 
an essential bacterial enzyme composed of two A and two B subunits, 
products of the gyrA  and gyrB  genes, respectively.6,7 DNA gyrase 
uniquely catalyzes the introduction of negative superhelical twists into 
closed covalently circular chromosomal and plasmid DNA within the 
bacterial cell. The superhelical state of intracellular DNA is regulated 
by the actions of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase I, which removes 
DNA superhelical twists but is not inhibited by quinolones. DNA 
superhelicity affects the initiation of DNA replication and transcription 
of many genes. DNA gyrase is also responsible for removing positive 
superhelical twists that accumulate ahead of the DNA replication fork. 
These activities result from the enzyme’s coordinated breaking of both 
strands of duplex DNA, passage of another segment of DNA through 
the break, and resealing of the break, a mechanism that defines type II  
topoisomerases.
Quinolones also inhibit the activities of topoisomerase IV , another 
type II topoisomerase that is composed of two subunits encoded by 
the parC  and parE  genes. Topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase are 
structurally related; parC  is homologous to gyrA , and parE  is homologous 
to gyrB .8 Topoisomerase IV functions to resolve (decatenate) interlinked 
(catenated) daughter DNA molecules that result from replication of 
circular DNA, to allow their segregation into daughter cells. Thus DNA 
gyrase and topoisomerase IV have distinct essential roles in bacterial 
DNA replication.9 Gyrase can mediate the functions of topoisomerase 
IV (albeit less efficiently as a decatenase), but topoisomerase IV is unable 
to introduce negative supercoils into DNA, a function that is unique 
to DNA gyrase. A few species of human pathogens (e.g., Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis , Treponema pallidum ) lack topoisomerase IV , and in the 
case of M. tuberculosis,  gyrase appears to serve the decatenation function 
of topoisomerase IV , in addition to its own functions.10
Quinolones inhibit enzyme function by blocking the resealing of 
the DNA double-stranded break, but in addition this process stabilizes 
a catalytic intermediate covalent complex of enzyme and DNA that 
serves as a barrier to movement of the DNA replication fork11 or transcrip -
tion complexes12 and can be converted to permanent double-stranded 
DNA breaks,13 thereby functioning as topoisomerase poisons and 
contributing to bactericidal activity.14 Quinolones have been shown to 
bind specifically to the complex of DNA gyrase and DNA rather than 
to DNA gyrase alone.15,16 Single gyrA  or gyrB  mutants of Escherichia 
coli can produce quinolone resistance in bacteria, resistance to gyrase 
inhibition, and gyrase-DNA complexes with reduced quinolone binding 
(see “ Mechanisms of Acquired Bacterial Resistance ”).16 In contrast to 
the information for E. coli,  which is also similar to that for other gram-
negative bacteria studied, for Staphylococcus aureus  and Streptococcus 
pneumoniae  interactions of quinolones with topoisomerase IV have 
been shown to determine antibacterial activity by the identification  
of parC  (initially named grlA in S. aureus ) and parE  (grlB in S.  
aureus ) single mutants that have reduced quinolone activity.17 Based 
on studies of mutants of this type, a general pattern has emerged. For 
most gram-negative bacteria, DNA gyrase is the primary quinolone 
target, and for many gram-positive bacteria, topoisomerase IV is the 
primary target, with gyrase being the secondary target. There are excep -
tions, however, that depend on the quinolone studied.18,19 These patterns 
appear to result from the relative sensitivities of these two topoisomerases 
to a given quinolone, with the more sensitive of the two enzymes in a 
particular bacterial species defining the primary target of a particular 
quinolone.20 Some quinolones under development appear to have similar 
potencies against both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV in some 
bacterial species.21,22

in many mutants of this type is pleiotropic, with additional low levels 
of resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, some β-lactams, and 
other antibiotics because of the broad substrate profiles of most such 
pumps; hence the term multidrug resistance  is often applied to these 
efflux pumps.44,55
In gram-positive bacteria, which lack an outer membrane, overexpres -
sion of endogenous efflux pumps has also been shown to cause low-level 
quinolone resistance. The S. aureus norA  gene encodes a native membrane 
protein that pumps hydrophilic quinolones, driven by the proton gradient 
across the cell membrane,56 and overexpression of NorA, because of a 
mutation in the norA  promoter region or in other regulators, causes 
resistance to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin, in order of 
decreasing magnitude of the effect on MICs.57 Some quinolones, such 
as moxifloxacin, are not affected by NorA overexpression. Other related 
pumps, such as NorB and NorC, can cause resistance to these quinolones 
as well.58,59 In S. pneumoniae,  PmrA, a pump with a structure similar 
to NorA, can also contribute to reduced quinolone susceptibility.60 
Reserpine, an inhibitor of several efflux pumps in gram-positive bacteria, 
improves MICs of some quinolones in clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae  
and viridans streptococci.61 Other efflux transporters of the major 
facilitator superfamily, like NorA, NorB, and NorC, that can contribute 
to quinolone resistance in S. aureus  include MdeA (norfloxacin, cipro -
floxacin),62 SdrM (norfloxacin),63 QacB(III) (norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin),64 
and LmrS (gatifloxacin),65 and in Listeria monocytogenes  Lde.66 Members 
of other pump families have also been shown to confer quinolone 
resistance, including MepA67 in S. aureus,  FepA in L. monocytogenes,  
PatAB68 in S. pneumoniae,  and SatAB69 in Streptococcus suis.  For reviews 
of clinically relevant chromosomally encoded multidrug resistance efflux 
pumps and their regulation, see the reviews by Piddock55 and by Hooper 
and Jacoby.30
Regulation of expression of many pumps is complex, and overexpres -
sion has in many cases been shown to be due to mutations in specific 
regulators or networks of regulators.30 Notably, expression can be 
selectively increased in certain infection environments and can contribute 
to fitness in those environments in the absence of antibiotics. In such 
cases, physiologic overexpression of drug resistance pumps in an infection 
environment could contribute to a reduced response to the affected 
antimicrobial, as well as discordance between determinations of bacterial 
susceptibility in vitro and responses to antimicrobials in vivo.
Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance, long thought not to occur, 
was first identified and verified in multidrug-resistant, clinical isolates 
of K. pneumoniae  from Alabama.70 Used as donors, these isolates 
transferred plasmids by conjugation to a recipient laboratory E. coli  
with selection for resistance to β-lactams. Unexpectedly, the recipients 
acquired low-level resistance to quinolones as well. The plasmid-encoded 
gene responsible for quinolone resistance, qnr, was located on class I 
integrons flanked by other resistance genes, which can transfer multidrug 
resistance en bloc with the plasmid.33 The gene qnr encodes a protein 
of the pentapeptide repeat family that is able to protect purified DNA 
gyrase and topoisomerase IV from quinolone action. How this protection 
occurs at the molecular level has not yet been defined. The plasmid-borne 
qnr genes currently comprise seven families— qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qnrC, 
qnrD, qnrE,  and qnrVC —and include multiple alleles.71,72 The qnr genes 
have already been detected worldwide and are found in 1% to 7% of 
tested Enterobacteriaceae, predominantly in strains of Enterobacter  spp., 
K. pneumoniae,  and E. coli.  Although resistance mediated by qnr genes 
alone is usually low level, qnr plasmids are usually found in strains of 
Enterobacteriaceae with additional chromosomal resistance mutations, 
and the presence of qnr has been shown to increase the frequency of 
selection of these mutations, presumably by reducing the quinolone 
therapeutic index.73
Resistance mediated by a fluoroquinolone-modifying enzyme has 
also been reported. A variant of the gene encoding aminoglycoside 
acetyltransferase Aac(6 ′)-Ib was able to reduce the activity of ciprofloxacin 
by N-acetylation at the amino nitrogen on its piperazinyl substituent.35 
The increase in the MIC conferred by Aac(6 ′)-Ib-cr was smaller than 
that conferred by Qnr proteins, and it was selective only for ciprofloxacin 
and norfloxacin, as predicted by their chemical structure. Other qui -
nolones lacking an unsubstituted piperazinyl nitrogen were unaffected the fact that both drugs exhibit similar loss of activity against purified 
DNA gyrase reconstituted with the resistant GyrA subunit.39 Thus 
quinolone interaction with a second target enzyme puts a ceiling on 
the magnitude of the increase in resistance caused by mutation in the 
first enzyme target. For some quinolones that have similar potency 
against both target enzymes, frequencies of selection of first-step mutants 
may be particularly low because single-target mutations produce little 
or no increment in resistance.40 Thus, for such quinolones, mutations 
in both targets are needed to produce substantial increments in the 
MIC. Serial passage of bacteria with increasing concentrations of 
quinolones selects mutants with high levels of resistance resulting from 
the additive effects of multiple mutations involving both enzyme targets.41
Alterations in the A subunit of DNA gyrase that cause quinolone 
resistance have been defined in a substantial number of clinical and 
laboratory isolates of E. coli.  These alterations are clustered between 
amino acids 67 and 106 in the amino terminus of the A protein near 
the active site of the enzyme (tyrosine-122).31 In particular, changes in 
serine-83 (to leucine or tryptophan) are most common and cause the 
largest increment in resistance, as well as reduced binding of drug to 
the gyrase-DNA complex in vitro. Leucine-83 causes a 128-fold increase 
in resistance to nalidixic acid but lesser increases in resistance to the 
newer fluoroquinolones (16- to 32-fold), thus likely accounting for the 
greater ease of selection of resistant mutants with nalidixic acid. Similar 
changes in the A subunit have been associated with resistance in many 
species of gram-negative bacteria. Single amino-acid changes in the 
midportion of the gyrase B protein have also been found to cause lower 
levels of resistance to nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones.31,42
Resistance mutations in the parC  gene of topoisomerase IV in S. 
aureus  and S. pneumoniae  have been most commonly found at position 
80, in which a wild-type serine (homologous to serine-83 of DNA gyrase) 
is replaced by phenylalanine or tyrosine.17,43 These mutations cause 
eightfold increases in resistance to several fluoroquinolones. Resistance 
mutations have also been found less commonly in the parE  gene, often 
in positions similar to those of resistance mutations in gyrB .31
Stepwise increasing resistance occurs by sequential mutations in the 
gyrA  (or gyrB ) and parC  (or parE ) genes, with the first target mutation 
occurring in a gene for the more sensitive target enzyme. In the most 
highly resistant clinical strains of both gram-positive and gram-negative 
bacteria, one or more mutations in both gyrA  and parC  have been 
found commonly. Some species, including M. tuberculosis, Helicobacter 
pylori,  and T. pallidum,  appear to lack genes for topoisomerase IV .31 
Thus target resistance may occur more readily in the absence of a second 
drug target to limit the effects of resistance mutations in gyrase.
The routes of quinolone permeation across bacterial cell membranes 
are not fully defined, but the hydrophilic quinolones appear to diffuse 
across the gram-negative bacterial outer membrane through porin 
channels. In E. coli  and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  resistance mutations 
in genes that affect expression of outer membrane proteins have been 
described.44,45 In both cases, resistance cannot be explained by reduced 
diffusion alone, and reduced drug accumulation in some mutants is 
energy dependent, being abolished by agents that collapse the proton 
gradient across the membrane. In E. coli,  resistance of multiple antibiotic 
resistance mutants, which exhibit reduced porin channels, is dependent 
on the AcrAB efflux pump, which is linked to the TolC outer membrane 
protein.46,47 Overexpression of AcrAB has also been associated with 
quinolone resistance in clinical isolates.48 In P . aeruginosa,  resistance 
has been shown to be caused by increased expression of one of several 
sets of three genes that encode an efflux pump in the inner membrane, 
a periplasm-spanning membrane fusion protein, and a linked outer 
membrane protein (e.g., MexAB-OprM, composed of the MexA 
membrane fusion protein, MexB inner membrane efflux pump, and 
OprM outer membrane protein).31,44,49 Such increased expression of one 
or more pump complexes is found commonly along with gyrA  mutations 
in quinolone-resistant clinical isolates of P . aeruginosa.50 AcrAB and 
MexAB are members of the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) family, 
which are common in gram-negative bacteria. Other RND pumps that 
confer quinolone resistance include MexCD-OprJ, MexEF-OprN, and 
MexXY-OprM ( P . aeruginosa ),51 AcrAB homologs ( Salmonella  spp.52 
and Enterobacter aerogenes53), CmeABC ( Campylobacter jejuni ), OqxAB-
TolC ( Klebsiella pneumoniae ),54 AdeABC and AdeFGH ( Acinetobacter

Other bacteria are also inhibited by quinolones in vitro (see Table 
35.1).88 Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, 
gemifloxacin, and delafloxacin all have activity against the agents of 
atypical pneumonias, including Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae,  and Chlamydia pneumoniae,  and against genital pathogens, 
such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum,  and Mycoplasma 
hominis. Treponema pallidum  is resistant to ofloxacin in animal models, 
and no other quinolone has been shown to have activity against this 
spirochete. Moxifloxacin, delafloxacin, and sitafloxacin among available 
quinolones have increased potency against anaerobes.
Activity in vitro is reduced in the presence of urine but generally 
not in the presence of serum. Activity is also reduced at pH values 
below 7 and in the presence of magnesium concentrations at 8 to 16  mM. 
Both of these factors often contribute to the reduced quinolone activity 
observed in the presence of urine. Unlike other fluoroquinolones, 
delafloxacin is weakly acidic, thus providing enhanced antibacterial 
potency and reducing the MICs of pathogens in environments with 
lower pH. Low pH and elevated concentrations of magnesium are 
associated with reduced drug accumulation in E. coli.78
Minimal bactericidal concentrations of quinolones are usually within 
twofold to fourfold of the MIC, and the magnitude of bacterial killing 
increases with further increases in drug concentration, reaching a 
maximum at about 30-fold above the MIC. Above this maximal killing 
concentration, paradoxical reductions in killing are observed and are 
associated with additional inhibition of protein synthesis by high 
concentrations of quinolones.5,89
The postantibiotic effect (PAE) is the period of time required for 
bacteria surviving a brief exposure to an antimicrobial agent to resume 
growth. Although PAE may be relevant in estimating the proper interval 
for drug dosing, its clinical importance, which may be greatest in patients 
with compromised host defenses, has not been proved. For quinolones, 
the duration of PAE has been in the range of 1 to 2 hours and tends to 
increase with increasing drug concentrations and length of drug exposure.
Combinations of quinolones with other antimicrobial agents have 
been extensively studied, and interactions with β-lactams and amino -
glycosides, as measured by fractional inhibitory or bactericidal concentra -
tions or time-kill curve studies, have generally been found to be indifferent 
or additive.77 Synergistic interactions were found in a minority of strains, 
although for P . aeruginosa  in some studies, synergy was seen in a 
substantial minority (30%–50%) of strains, including those already 
lacking susceptibility to one or both drugs.90–92 Antagonistic interactions 
of quinolones with other antimicrobial agents have been rare. Rifampin 
reduced the bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin against S. aureus  and 
of moxifloxacin against M. tuberculosis  in some studies.93,94
PHARMACOLOGY
Absorption
The quinolones are well absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract, 
with bioavailability exceeding 50% for all compounds and approaching 
100% for several ( Table 35.4 ).95,96 Peak concentrations in serum are 
usually attained within 1 to 3 hours of administering a dose. Neither 
food nor achlorhydria substantially affects the extent of quinolone 
absorption, but food may delay the time to reach peak drug concentra -
tions in serum.97,98 Enteral feedings given orally, however, may reduce 
absorption.99 Absorption is good when ciprofloxacin is given by 
nasogastric or jejunostomy tube100 but may be decreased by concurrent 
enteral feedings given through these tubes.99
Peak fluoroquinolone concentrations in serum, after a 200-mg to 
500-mg dose, range from 1.4 to 1.5 µg/mL for gemifloxacin and nor -
floxacin to 5.7 and 7.45 µg/mL for levofloxacin and delafloxacin, 
respectively (see Table 35.4 ). A 1-g dose of nalidixic acid produces 
concentrations of 20 to 50 µg/mL of serum. Drug binding to serum 
proteins (see Table 35.4 ) is generally low (30%–50%) but is higher for 
gemifloxacin (55%–72%) and delafloxacin (84%).
Distribution in Tissues
The volumes of distribution of quinolones are high and in most cases, 
with the exception of delafloxacin, exceed the volume of total body 
water (see Table 35.4 ), indicating accumulation in some tissues. (see Fig. 35.1 ). Although the increase in the MIC of ciprofloxacin and 
norfloxacin was modest (threefold to fourfold), the effect on mutant 
prevention concentration was marked and facilitated selection of resistant 
clones of wild-type E. coli  at 1.6 µg/mL, a level approximating the peak 
serum concentration of free ciprofloxacin during therapy.35 The gene 
aac(6 ′)-Ib-cr , like the qnr genes, is now common worldwide and also 
associated with multidrug resistance.
Recently a second plasmid-encoded quinolone-modifying enzyme 
was reported.74 The gene crpP  was found on a plasmid in a clinical 
isolate of P . aeruginosa  and when cloned in E. coli  conferred a selective 
eightfold increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin but not other quinolones. 
Purified CrpP phosphorylated the carboxyl group of ciprofloxacin in 
an ATP-dependent fashion, and the phosphorylated ciprofloxacin was 
followed by subsequent degradation steps. The extent to which crpP  is 
found in clinical isolates and its contribution to ciprofloxacin resistance 
in P . aeruginosa  remains uncertain.
Two plasmid-mediated quinolone efflux pumps have also been found: 
OqxAB, which confers resistance to the antibiotic olaquindox (a qui -
noxaline derivative that is used in agriculture as a veterinary growth 
promoter) as well as an increased MIC to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, 
and QepA, which mediates increased resistance to several antibiotics, 
including ciprofloxacin and erythromycin.75,76
ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY
Current quinolones are most active against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, 
particularly members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus  
spp., and against gram-negative cocci, such as Neisseria  spp. and Moraxella 
(Branhamella) catarrhalis  (Table 35.1 ).77–80 Relative to nalidixic acid, 
the fluoroquinolones also have additional activity against gram-negative 
bacilli, such as P . aeruginosa  (see Table 35.1 ), and against staphylococci 
(Table 35.2 ). Ciprofloxacin remains the most potent marketed fluoro -
quinolone against gram-negative bacteria, and it and levofloxacin in 
the United States and sitafloxacin in Japan are the only available qui -
nolones with sufficient potency for use against susceptible strains of P.  
aeruginosa.  Resistance may emerge easily, however, when these quinolones 
are used alone for treatment of serious pseudomonal infections. For 
norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin, activity against streptococci 
and many anaerobes is limited ( Table 35.3 ; see also Table 35.2 ). Agents 
released subsequently in the United States—levofloxacin, gatifloxacin 
(marketed as an ophthalmic solution), moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and 
delafloxacin—however, have greater potency against these organisms, 
with gemifloxacin and delafloxacin being especially potent against S. 
pneumoniae  and S. aureus,  respectively. For the fluoroquinolones that 
are used for treatment of infections outside the urinary tract, the MICs 
listed in Table 35.1  should be interpreted in relation to peak drug 
concentrations in serum, which range from 1.1 to 6.4 µg/mL (with 
usual dosing), and in relation to drug concentrations in urine that are 
manyfold higher for most quinolones, except those that are largely 
excreted by nonrenal mechanisms (see “ Pharmacology ”). For highly 
susceptible organisms, MICs may be 10- to 30-fold below achievable 
serum concentrations. Oral ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are recom -
mended for prophylaxis of anthrax, with potential similar efficacy and 
toxicity to doxycycline. For treatment of severe anthrax disease, parenteral 
fluoroquinolones are favored over doxycycline.81 It should be noted that 
quinolone resistance can be selected for in Bacillus anthracis.82 Thus 
efficacy may not be predicted in the unfortunate case of use of B. anthracis  
as an agent of bioterrorism. Among the currently available fluoroqui -
nolones with activity against S. aureus,  only delafloxacin exhibits a low 
probability for selection of resistant mutants and is thus recommended 
for skin and soft tissue infections.
Fluoroquinolones also have activity against mycobacteria (see Table 
35.3).77,83 Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and 
moxifloxacin are active against M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium fortuitum, 
Mycobacterium kansasii,  and some strains of Mycobacterium chelonae  
but, except for moxifloxacin, have only fair or poor activity against 
Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare  complex. Ofloxacin and pefloxacin 
have activity against Mycobacterium leprae  in animal models. Inclusion 
of fluoroquinolones added to the bactericidal activity but failed to 
contribute to shortening the duration of treatment for pulmonary 
tuberculosis,84,85 or improve survival in tuberculous meningitis.86,87Text continued on p. 436

Hepatic metabolism accounts for the majority of the elimination of 
moxifloxacin and nalidixic acid. In the latter case, however, active 
metabolites contribute to antibacterial effects. The hydroxynalidixic 
derivative of nalidixic acid is more active than its parent compound. 
The metabolites and inactive glucuronide conjugate to the 3-carboxyl 
group are excreted in the urine. Conversion of norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, 
and delafloxacin to less active metabolites accounts for 10% to 20% of 
elimination. There is minimal hepatic biotransformation ( <10%) of 
ofloxacin and levofloxacin. Hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion 
are the principal routes of elimination of moxifloxacin ( >60% of dose; 
38% sulfoconjugation, 14% glucuronide conjugation). In addition to 
glucuronide conjugates and desmethylpiperazinyl derivatives, other 
metabolites of quinolones that have been identified have had predomi -
nantly alterations of the piperazine ring, including N-oxide, N-sulfo, 
N-formyl, and desethylene derivatives.95,107
Transintestinal secretion has been identified after intravenous (IV) 
administration of ciprofloxacin and accounts for about 10% to 15% of 
drug excretion,107 and this effect may be mediated by P-glycoprotein 
and other intestinal transporters.95
Dosage Adjustments in Renal and 
Hepatic Insufficiency
As expected from differences in the routes of excretion, increases in 
drug half-life in the presence of severe renal insufficiency are greatest 
for ofloxacin and levofloxacin (fourfold to fivefold) and least for 
moxifloxacin (no change), with other quinolones exhibiting intermediate 
effects (about twofold). To prevent excessive drug accumulation, dosage 
reduction (increase in the dose interval from 12 to 24 hours or halving 
the daily dose for those quinolones normally given once daily; see Table 
35.6) is indicated at creatinine clearances below 50  mL/min for ofloxacin 
and levofloxacin, below 40 mL/min for gemifloxacin, and below 30 mL/
min for norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and delafloxacin. For delafloxacin, 
dose reduction is advised for the intravenous formulation because of 
concern over potential toxicities associated with accumulation of the 
intravenous vehicle, sulfobutylether- β-cyclodextrin. No dosage reduction 
is indicated for nalidixic acid and moxifloxacin. Clearance by hemo -
dialysis is low ( <14% of plasma clearance) for norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, 
ofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin.108 Similarly, peritoneal dialysis 
contributes little to the clearance of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.109 
Continuous venovenous hemofiltration in patients with severe renal 
failure constitutes 16% to 70% clearance of levofloxacin, 6% to 37% 
clearance of ciprofloxacin,110,111 and about 9% clearance of moxifloxacin.112 
In patients on continuous venovenous hemofiltration, levofloxacin is 
dosed at 250 mg/day and ciprofloxacin at 400 mg/day. No dose adjustment 
is needed for moxifloxacin.
Fewer data are available on the effects of hepatic insufficiency on 
quinolone half-lives, but there is no need for dosage adjustments of 
norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and delafloxacin.113 Concentrations in prostate tissue, stool, bile, lung, and neutrophils and 
macrophages usually exceed serum concentrations ( Table 35.5 ). Con -
centrations in urine and kidney tissue are high for quinolones with a 
major renal route of elimination, particularly so for levofloxacin and 
substantially less for moxifloxacin, which has a major route of nonrenal 
elimination. Concentrations of quinolones in saliva, prostatic fluid, bone, 
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are usually lower than drug concentrations 
in serum. Active transport systems appear to be involved in reducing 
concentrations of levofloxacin in CSF .101 Fluoroquinolones vary in terms 
of penetration into the CSF . Their penetration into the CSF in the absence 
of meningeal inflammation is, however, much higher than that of β-lactam 
antibiotics.102 In patients with tuberculous meningitis, CSF penetration 
(AUC CSF/AUC plasma ratio) of levofloxacin was similar to that of moxi -
floxacin and greater than that of ciprofloxacin.103,104 Penetration into 
ascitic fluid in patients with liver failure has been found for ofloxacin 
(120%).105 Penetration into human breast milk has also been documented 
for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.106
Elimination
The terminal half-lives of elimination from serum range from 3 hours 
for norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 12 hours for moxifloxacin, allowing 
twice- or once-daily dosing ( Table 35.6 ; see also Table 35.4 ). The principal 
routes of elimination differ among quinolones. Ofloxacin, levofloxacin, 
and sitafloxacin are eliminated predominantly by the kidneys, and 
nalidixic acid and moxifloxacin are eliminated predominantly by nonrenal 
pathways. Most other quinolones have mixed excretion by both renal 
and nonrenal routes.
Renal clearances of norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sitafloxacin, 
and levofloxacin exceed glomerular filtration rates, indicating net tubular 
secretion. In support of tubular secretion, renal clearances of norfloxacin 
and ciprofloxacin are reduced by probenecid, but drug accumulation 
does not occur. In contrast, the renal clearance of pefloxacin is below 
or equal to the glomerular filtration rate, suggesting net tubular 
reabsorption.107

on the active S-enantiomer or prothrombin times.125 Case reports of 
patients who developed bleeding while on warfarin and ciprofloxacin 
have appeared, however, suggesting that in uncommon special settings, 
quinolone promotion of an anticoagulant effect of warfarin may occur, 
possibly caused by other concomitant therapies, by effects on microbial 
flora that synthesize vitamin K in the intestine, or by changes in patients’ 
food intake, or promoted by the underlying disease conditions or genetic 
predispositions, which would not be reflected in data collected in 
controlled clinical studies. Limited case series suggest that treatment 
with moxifloxacin, which has enhanced activity against anaerobic bacteria 
compared with either ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, may prolong the 
prothrombin time earlier than the other quinolones.126 A case-control 
study of continuous warfarin users older than 65 years identified an 
association between exposure to quinolones and an increased risk of 
bleeding, albeit lower than that with other antibiotics.127 As a precaution, 
prothrombin times should be rechecked in patients on warfarin after 
initiation of quinolones or other antimicrobial agents. When mixed 
with heparin as a lock solution used for the treatment of catheter-related 
bloodstream infection, the maximum concentration of ciprofloxacin is 
limited because of precipitation at higher concentrations.128
Disturbances of glucose metabolism have been rarely reported with 
quinolones, but there have been case reports of elevated glyburide levels 
and hypoglycemia in a diabetic patient given ciprofloxacin and in several 
patients receiving gatifloxacin and hypoglycemic agents.110 These effects 
were unexpected and not fully explained. Glyburide may be metabolized 
by CYP2C9, which is not known to be affected by quinolones, and 
when directly studied, there was no detectable effect of gatifloxacin on 
glyburide metabolism or glucose tolerance in diabetic volunteers. 
Furthermore, hypoglycemia has been reported in patients receiving 
gatifloxacin and clinafloxacin without concomitant hypoglycemic agents, 
and hyperglycemia has also been reported in patients receiving gati -
floxacin. Thus effects in addition to potential drug interactions likely 
contribute to the occurrences (see “ Adverse Events ”).
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may affect the central 
nervous system stimulant effects of some quinolones. Seizures were 
reported in a group of Japanese patients receiving enoxacin and the 
NSAID fenbufen. Potentiation of seizures by combinations of quinolones 
and NSAIDs has also been reported in animals. Assays of the displace -
ment of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 
or a related molecule from GABA receptors in rat brain tissue have 
demonstrated displacement of GABA by quinolones and enhancement 
of this displacement by fenbufen and by theophylline.127,129 Clinical 
experience does not suggest, however, that concurrent use of quinolones 
other than enoxacin with other NSAIDs will result in central nervous 
system toxicities, but patients receiving both classes of drugs should be 
cautioned about and monitored for these potential adverse effects.
Although probenecid reduces the renal clearance of norfloxacin and 
fleroxacin, no quinolone accumulation occurred. The effect of probenecid 
might be predicted to be greater with quinolones such as ofloxacin and 
lomefloxacin, for which renal clearance includes tubular secretion and 
is the predominant mode of clearance, but data are lacking.
CLINICAL USES
Earlier quinolones such as nalidixic acid, oxolinic acid, and cinoxacin 
were used almost exclusively for treatment of urinary tract infections, 
although nalidixic acid was also used for treatment of shigellosis. With 
the development of the more potent fluoroquinolones, an increasingly 
broad array of infections is treated with members of the fluoroquinolone 
class.
Urinary Tract Infections
Although the low pH and magnesium concentrations present in urine 
may reduce quinolone activity, the concentrations of many quinolones 
in urine are usually sufficient to provide substantial therapeutic ratios 
of urinary drug concentration to the MIC of most urinary pathogens.
For uncomplicated urinary tract infections, usually in symptomatic 
young women with cystitis caused by highly susceptible organisms such as 
E. coli,  most quinolones are likely to be highly effective when given for brief 
courses of 3 to 10 days,129a–129c and norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin Changes in renal function that accompany severe liver disease may, 
however, affect ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin elimination to a lesser extent.
Interactions With Other Drugs
When coadministered by mouth with aluminum-, magnesium-, or, to 
a lesser extent, calcium-containing antacids, quinolones have markedly 
reduced oral bioavailability, presumably because of the formation of 
cation-quinolone complexes that are poorly absorbed.114,115 Sucralfate, 
which contains large amounts of aluminum ions, also reduces absorption 
of quinolones. Tablets should be taken at least 2 hours before or 2 to 6 
hours after these drugs. In general, histamine type 2 receptor antagonists 
and proton pump inhibitors do not have important effects on absorption 
of quinolones. Concurrent administration of quinolones with iron sulfate, 
multivitamin-mineral regimens containing zinc, and the buffered formula -
tion of dideoxyinosine has also been reported to reduce quinolone 
absorption.116 Nutritional supplements given by nasogastric tube may 
reduce the absorption of quinolones given concurrently by the same 
route, probably because these supplements also contain multivalent 
cations such as iron and zinc. Concomitant administration of morphine 
decreases maximal serum concentrations of oral ciprofloxacin by 35% 
to 50%.
For intravenous formulations of ciprofloxacin, precipitates have been 
reported when these quinolones were infused through the same 
intravenous tubing with aminophylline, amoxicillin with and without 
clavulanate, or flucloxacillin. Separate infusions are indicated.
Quinolones vary in the extent to which they impair the elimination 
of the methylxanthines theophylline and caffeine. The effects appear to 
result from inhibition by some quinolones of hepatic cytochrome P-450 
isozyme 1A2 (CYP1A2),117 which is involved in theophylline and caffeine 
metabolism. With ciprofloxacin, a 30% reduction in clearance and 20% 
to 90% increases in serum concentrations of theophylline are observed, 
but norfloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gemifloxacin 
had little or no effect (2%–11% increases in serum concentrations of 
theophylline).115,118,119 In patients receiving ciprofloxacin in combination 
with theophylline, serum levels of theophylline should be monitored 
and reductions in the dose of theophylline considered. No such adjust -
ments should be needed in patients receiving theophylline concurrently 
with other fluoroquinolones. Concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin 
at the usual daily dose (500 mg twice daily) with caffeine resulted in a 
higher peak serum concentration (C max) and cumulative 24-hour serum 
concentration of ciprofloxacin in females relative to males. This effect, 
however, disappeared when parameters were corrected for body weight.120
Tizanidine, clozapine, and methadone are also metabolized by 
CYP1A2. Concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine 
may increase the central nervous system and systemic hypotensive effects 
of the latter.121 Low doses of ciprofloxacin have increased serum levels 
of clozapine, and one patient was reported to have developed symptoms 
of methadone overdose while taking ciprofloxacin.122 Thus the effects 
of ciprofloxacin on tizanidine, clozapine, and methadone (and possibly 
other drugs affected by CYP1A2, such as haloperidol, mexiletine, 
cimetidine, and paroxetine) should be monitored similar to those with 
methylxanthines.
Another hepatic P-450 isozyme, CYP3A4, is affected by many classes 
of antimicrobials, which can be inhibitors, inducers, or substrates of 
this metabolism enzyme. Such antimicrobials include macrolides, 
streptogramins, rifampin, azoles, and a variety of antiretroviral agents 
but not quinolones. Thus the occasional case reports of apparent interac -
tions of quinolones with other drugs interacting with CYP3A4 are 
difficult to assess for their importance or predictive value. Such case 
reports include those associating ciprofloxacin with increased cyclosporine  
levels and nephrotoxicity or increased levels of diazepam.115
Moxifloxacin is coadministered with rifampicin in the treatment of 
mycobacterial and other bacterial infections. Increased activity of the 
sulfate conjugation pathway of moxifloxacin metabolism by rifampicin 
has been shown to reduce moxifloxacin levels, potentially associated 
with reduced efficacy, and may warrant an increase of moxifloxacin 
dosage.123,124 In direct studies of interactions of warfarin with quinolones, 
no effects on coagulation tests were seen generally, and in those cases 
in which a drug interaction was seen (ciprofloxacin), there was an 
increase in the relatively inactive R-enantiomer of warfarin, which is

fluoroquinolone therapy.149 Ciprofloxacin is the preferred fluoroquinolone 
for treatment of P . aeruginosa  infections, and when chosen, doses of at 
least 500 mg orally twice daily should be used. In patients with bladder 
dysfunction resulting from spinal cord injury who used intermittent 
suprapubic taps or self-catheterization for bladder emptying, ciprofloxacin 
(100 mg at bedtime) reduced episodes of infection about 10-fold relative 
to placebo.150 Whereas infections in the placebo group represented a 
mixture of enteric and nonenteric bacteria and enterococci, breakthrough 
infections in the ciprofloxacin group were largely nonenteric bacteria, 
particularly P . aeruginosa,  which were often resistant.
Fluoroquinolones are now commonly used in prophylaxis in urologic 
surgery. When postoperative bacteriuria, but not other secondary 
outcomes, was the parameter to define efficacy of antimicrobial pro -
phylaxis, single-dose ciprofloxacin (500 mg) or levofloxacin (500 mg) 
has been shown to be effective after transurethral prostate resection 
and transrectal prostate biopsies,151–157 but infections with quinolone-
resistant E. coli  have been seen increasingly with this use (see “ Prostatitis ”). 
There is no evidence that prophylaxis should extend beyond 24 hours 
after a procedure.158,159 Prophylaxis of urinary tract infection in renal 
transplant recipients is routinely done because of high risk from infection. 
Although ciprofloxacin is effective,160 TMP-SMX is often used because 
it may be additionally useful as prophylaxis against other opportunistic 
pathogens in this patient group.
Prostatitis
Fluoroquinolones concentrate in prostatic tissue, with lower levels in 
prostatic fluid. In one small comparative study of men with predominantly 
E. coli  infections, norfloxacin given for 4 to 6 weeks was superior (92% 
eradication) to TMP-SMX (67% eradication) at 1-month follow-up.161 
In open studies, similar courses of norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, 
and levofloxacin have produced eradication rates of 60% to 86% at 
follow-up, ranging from 1 to 13 months.162,163 Similar results were obtained 
with levofloxacin and prulifloxacin (a fluoroquinolone marketed outside 
the United States).164 With 2-week courses of therapy and infections 
caused by less susceptible organisms, such as P . aeruginosa  and entero -
cocci, failures appear to be more frequent.113,165 Recent studies indicate 
that approximately 11% to 22% of men undergoing transrectal prostate 
biopsy harbor fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms within the rectum 
before the administration of antimicrobials, and that fecal carriage of 
fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli  strains was a risk factor for infectious 
complications after prostate biopsy.166,167 Fluoroquinolone-resistant E. 
coli sequence type 131 has been the predominant clone causing blood -
stream infection after transrectal prostate biopsy.166 Two strategies for 
the prevention of infection have recently emerged: “augmented” standard 
fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside prophylaxis with a second agent, 
and targeted prophylaxis guided by prebiopsy screening for rectal colo -
nization with ciprofloxacin-resistant organisms.168–170 Although prebiopsy 
rectal screening is favored with respect to antibiotic stewardship goals, 
its implementation is more difficult to achieve.
Sexually Transmitted Diseases
Neisseria gonorrhoeae  is an important pathogen in urogenital diseases, 
anogenital diseases, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Because 
patients are managed on the basis of presenting symptoms and signs 
and associated risk factors (i.e., syndromic approach), stringent clinical 
efficacy criteria are used to ensure that therapy is effective against this 
pathogen.171,172 After the emergence of quinolone resistance among N. 
gonorrhoeae  strains, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC), in April 2007, ceased recommending fluoroquinolones in its 
treatment guidelines.173 Earlier data indicate, however, that susceptible 
strains can be treated with quinolones. Quinolones have retained activ -
ity in vitro against the sexually transmitted pathogens C. trachomatis  
and Haemophilus ducreyi,  but they appear to lack activity against  
T. pallidum.174
Uncomplicated quinolone-susceptible gonococcal urethritis and 
cervicitis are effectively eradicated by single doses of quinolones 
(norfloxacin, 800 mg; ciprofloxacin, 250 mg; ofloxacin, 400 mg).175,176 
Rectal infections appear to have virtually complete cure rates with all 
of these quinolones, and pharyngeal infections are similarly highly cured 
by ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.176,177have been found to be comparable to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
(TMP-SMX)129d and nitrofurantoin129b,129e,129f and better than amoxicillin-
clavulanate.129g Usually, the lowest dose in the dosage range (see Table 
35.6) is sufficient for treatment of these infections. Three-day regimens 
of norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin result in cure rates of 81% to 
96%.129b An extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin (500 mg oral 
[PO] once daily) was comparable to conventional ciprofloxacin (250 mg 
PO twice daily) when both were given for 3 days.129h,129i Limited data on 
single-dose therapies with ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin indicate 
eradication in 75% to 96% of patients.129j,129k Single-dose norfloxacin 
(800 mg) was equivalent to a 3-day regimen for E. coli  infections,129l but 
for Staphylococcus saprophyticus  infections, a 7-day regimen is preferred 
because of failures with shorter courses.129m,129n Women with uncomplicated 
acute pyelonephritis given norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin (either orally or 
intravenously),129o or ofloxacin for 7 to 10 days have bacteriologic cure 
rates comparable to or better than those with TMP-SMX, and levofloxacin 
and ciprofloxacin were comparable to each other with 95% eradication 
rates.129p,129q,130
Increased fluoroquinolone resistance among community uropathogens 
and associated microbiologic and clinical failure, similar to that observed 
with TMP-SMX, is a major consideration when deciding to use fluo -
roquinolone for urinary tract infections.131,132 A disturbing finding has 
been the widespread distribution of urinary tract infections caused by 
multidrug-resistant E. coli  clonal groups in the United States and 
worldwide.133,134 Of interest, strains belonging to this clone were found 
to harbor the gene aac(6 ′)-Ib-cr.135 In addition, the potential for collateral 
damage (i.e., the selection of drug-resistant organisms and colonization 
or infection with multidrug-resistant organisms) complicates the use 
of this antimicrobial class. The Infectious Diseases Society of America 
(IDSA) incorporated these considerations into their guidelines.130 The 
recommended antibiotics for acute uncomplicated cystitis are nitrofu -
rantoin, TMP-SMX, fosfomycin, or pivmecillinam, whereas a 3-day 
fluoroquinolone is a second-line treatment option. For acute pyelone -
phritis, fluoroquinolones (5–7 days) are an appropriate choice for therapy 
in settings where the prevalence of resistance of community uropathogens 
to fluoroquinolones is not known to exceed 10%.130,136–138 Rates of 
resistance, however, have been higher (approaching 30%) in recently 
reported surveys of extraintestinal E. coli  isolates in the United States, 
due in part to the emergence of the H30 subclone of sequence type 
ST131.139 For prophylaxis of recurrent infections in women, norfloxacin 
(200 mg at bedtime) was highly effective and superior to nitrofurantoin,140 
and low doses of ofloxacin (100 mg), norfloxacin (200 mg), and cipro -
floxacin (125 mg) given after coitus have also been effective as prophy -
laxis.141 Other agents, such as nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX, are preferred 
for this indication, however, because of expense, collateral damage, and 
the risks of potential pregnancy.
Cystitis occurring in elderly women is more often complicated by 
comorbid conditions and is more likely to be caused by pathogens, in 
addition to E. coli,  that are less susceptible to antimicrobial agents. For 
such infections, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin given for 7 days have high 
eradication rates but have no clear advantage over a short course.142
Complicated urinary tract infections occurring in men and in patients 
with catheters or structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary 
tract are often caused by more resistant pathogens and have a higher 
frequency of relapse and reinfection. Bacteriologic cure rates for cip -
rofloxacin were superior to those for TMP-SMX and aminoglycosides 
shortly after completion of a 7- to 10-day course, but the low fractions 
of patients who continued to have sterile urine were similar by 4 to 6 
weeks after therapy.138,143–145 In patients with spinal cord injury, treatment 
with ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily) for 3 and 14 days had similar 
clinical cure. The percentage of patients with microbiologic cure was, 
however, significantly higher for the 14-day treatment arm at long-term 
follow-up and was attributable to the significantly lower rates of both 
clinical and microbiologic relapse.146 High cure rates were seen with 
both ofloxacin and levofloxacin.147,148 In collected noncomparative trials, 
infections caused by P . aeruginosa  were eradicated in 70% of patients 
given ciprofloxacin and 83% of those given norfloxacin. Development 
of bacterial resistance has been associated with therapeutic failure in 
about 2% of patients overall, but resistance rates (10%–20%) are often 
higher for P . aeruginosa  infections, and resistance can be selected with

norfloxacin (400 mg twice daily for 3 days)202 and ciprofloxacin (500  mg 
single dose)197 were shown to shorten diarrhea by 1 to 3 days relative 
to placebo.
In patients with shigellosis, for whom antimicrobials are generally 
indicated, 5-day courses of norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin 
have been highly effective and generally at least as effective as comparator 
agents, including ampicillin, TMP-SMX, azithromycin, and ceftriax -
one.192,203 Addition of loperamide to ciprofloxacin may further shorten 
the duration of diarrhea, but there is risk of clinical worsening and 
intestinal perforation in this condition.204 Even a single 750-mg dose 
of ciprofloxacin may be effective in shigellosis, except those cases caused 
by Shigella dysenteriae  type 1, the most virulent of Shigella  types.205 
Failure rates for ciprofloxacin have increased, however, associated with 
the emergence of strains resistant to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, 
particularly in Asia and Africa.206
In patients with nontyphoidal Salmonella  gastroenteritis, symptoms 
were shortened with ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin in some207,208 but not 
all studies.209 Eradication of stool carriage of Salmonella  is generally 
transient,208,210 but carriage is not necessarily prolonged relative to no 
treatment.211 Treatment of Salmonella  gastroenteritis is generally not 
indicated, except in immunocompromised and elderly patients because 
of the risk of invasive disease. In immunocompromised hosts, systemic, 
nontyphoidal Salmonella  infections have been successfully treated with 
ciprofloxacin, but there have been no comparative trials and some relapses 
have occurred in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
patients.212
For C. jejuni  gastroenteritis, studies of treatment with quinolones 
have had variable results. Ciprofloxacin (500  mg twice daily for 5 days)213 
and norfloxacin (400 mg twice daily for 5 days)208 were superior to 
placebo. Clinical and microbiologic failures have been associated with 
development of resistant C. jejuni  in some,196,214 but not in all, studies 
using ciprofloxacin.211 Quinolone resistance in C. jejuni  has increased. 
In the 1990s, a CDC survey in selected US counties did not detect 
ciprofloxacin resistance among a sample of C. jejuni  isolates from sick 
people; the resistance rate subsequently rose from 17% in 1997–1999214a 
to 25% in 2012–2014. In a trial done in the years 2000 and 2001 on US 
military personnel based in Thailand who presented with acute diarrhea, 
50% of the Campylobacter  isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones, 
and levofloxacin (500 mg daily for 3 days) was clinically and microbiologi -
cally inferior to 1 or 3 days of azithromycin.215
For treatment of patients with cholera, norfloxacin (400 mg twice 
daily for 3 days) was shown to be superior to TMP-SMX, a single dose 
of doxycycline, and placebo in shortening diarrhea,216,217 and 3 days of 
ciprofloxacin (250 mg once daily) and a standard tetracycline (500 mg 
four times daily) regimen were comparable.218 A single dose of cipro -
floxacin (1 g) or two 500-mg doses of ciprofloxacin has been effective 
and superior to doxycycline in shortening diarrhea and eradicating 
Vibrio cholerae  from stool.218,219 A single 20-mg/kg dose of ciprofloxacin 
achieved clinical outcomes similar to, or better than, those achieved 
with erythromycin (12.5 mg/kg every 6 hours for 3 days).220 In some 
areas, such as Bangladesh, however, progressively decreasing susceptibility 
to ciprofloxacin has been more recently observed along with low efficacy 
(27%) of single doses of ciprofloxacin.221,222 In patients with diarrhea 
caused by Yersinia enterocolitica, Plesiomonas shigelloides,  and Aeromonas  
spp., quinolones have eradicated the organisms from stool but have not 
yet been clearly shown to shorten clinical illness.192
In studies performed in the late 1980s and early 1990s in patients 
with enteric fever caused predominantly by Salmonella enterica  serovar 
Typhi or serovar Paratyphi, 7-day courses of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin 
cured over 90% of patients, shown to be superior to ceftriaxone, with 
resolution of fever within 5 days.223 Since the mid-1990s, outbreaks of 
serovar Typhi strains that were resistant to nalidixic acid (the prototype 
quinolone that was used for in vitro screening tests) and had reduced 
susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin MIC of 0.25–1.0 µg/mL) 
have been reported in a number of countries and in travelers to them.223,224 
Clinical failures and delayed defervescence after short courses (2–3 
days) of ofloxacin were more frequent in patients with nalidixic acid–
resistant strains versus those with nalidixic acid–susceptible strains.225–228 
Gatifloxacin, which targets both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV , Single doses of quinolones are ineffective for genital chlamydial 
infections.143 Seven-day courses of therapy with norfloxacin and cipro -
floxacin have failed, but 7-day courses of ofloxacin and levofloxacin 
were comparable to a similar course of doxycycline for treatment of 
chlamydial infections.178–181 In a more recent study, sitafloxacin (which 
is not currently available in the United States) 100 mg twice daily for 
7 days was effective against symptomatic nongonococcal urethritis in 
heterosexual men.182
Small numbers of patients with gonococcal and nongonococcal PID 
have been cured with 10- to 14-day courses of sequential intravenous 
and oral ciprofloxacin or oral ofloxacin.183,184 Results from three more 
recent randomized clinical trials of treatment for PID, a syndrome with 
mixed microbiology, including gonococci, chlamydiae, enteric bacteria, 
and anaerobes, have been published. Ofloxacin (400 mg twice daily for 
10 days) and cefoxitin (2 g intramuscularly [IM] once) plus doxycycline 
(100 mg twice daily for 10 days) were similar, and ofloxacin was highly 
effective in eradicating gonococci and chlamydiae.185 Ciprofloxacin 
(250 mg twice daily) plus clindamycin (300 mg three times daily) given 
for 14 days was also comparable to ceftriaxone plus doxycycline, with 
high clinical cure rates, and was effective for C. trachomatis  eradication 
(100% in both groups).186 In randomized trials, moxifloxacin (400 mg 
once daily) monotherapy was clinically and bacteriologically as efficacious 
as metronidazole (500 mg twice daily) plus either ofloxacin (400 mg 
twice daily) or levofloxacin, with all drugs administered for 14 days.187 
In the latter trial, a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone was also 
given if N. gonorrhoeae  was detected.
In patients with chancroid, H. ducreyi  was eradicated from genital 
ulcers by ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily for 3 days) in all patients, 
a result comparable to that with TMP-SMX.188 A once-daily dose of 
500 mg or 250 mg for 5 days was effective in 88% of patients.188 In 
another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 
single-dose ciprofloxacin (500 mg) was comparable to a 7-day course 
of erythromycin (500 mg three times daily), with an overall cure rate 
of 92%.189 The 3-day ciprofloxacin regimen is an option for treatment 
of chancroid in the CDC guidelines.190
Two cases of septic arthritis with susceptible gonococci have 
responded to ciprofloxacin. For bacterial vaginosis, ofloxacin was less 
effective than metronidazole.191 There are no data on treatment of syphilis 
with quinolones in humans, but in experimentally infected rabbits, 
ofloxacin lacked efficacy.
Gastrointestinal and Abdominal 
Infections
Quinolones were active against all bacterial pathogens known to cause 
gastroenteritis, but resistance has emerged in some settings. Although 
fecal material may decrease the activity of quinolones, drug concentrations 
in feces are exceedingly high. The penetration of quinolones into 
macrophages (see Table 35.5 ) may also be important for their effectiveness 
in systemic Salmonella  infections.
Bacterial gastroenteritis is often a self-limited disease, but in a number 
of circumstances quinolones have been shown to shorten the duration 
of diarrhea and to eradicate pathogens from stools.192 In traveler’s 
diarrhea, which is often caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli  and Shigella  
spp., norfloxacin (400 mg twice daily for 3 days) and ciprofloxacin 
(500  mg twice daily for 5 days), begun shortly after the onset of diarrhea, 
have shortened the duration of loose stools by 1 to 3 days relative to 
placebo and have been comparable to TMP-SMX.193,194 Because of 
resistance to TMP-SMX among E. coli  in many parts of the developing 
world, quinolones are often the preferred therapeutic agents in travelers.195 
Single-dose therapies, including ciprofloxacin (500 mg or 1 g)196,197 and 
ofloxacin (400 mg),198 are also effective with or without loperamide for 
this indication. After the emergence of quinolone resistance, the combina -
tion of levofloxacin and loperamide was evaluated in adult US military 
personnel or their families located in Turkey and who presented with 
acute noninflammatory diarrhea, and the effectiveness was comparable 
to that of azithromycin plus loperamide.199 When given as prophylaxis 
to travelers, quinolones have produced protection rates ranging from 
68% to 92% compared with those in placebo control subjects, but routine 
use of quinolones or other antimicrobials is not recommended for 
prevention of diarrhea in travelers.192,200,201 Contingency treatment at

Use of quinolones in peritonitis has been evaluated most in patients 
undergoing chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and in 
patients with cirrhosis. Oral ofloxacin, 300 mg once daily, and cipro -
floxacin, 500 mg once daily, have cured episodes of peritonitis in CAPD 
patients, but failures in infections caused by the common coagulase-
negative staphylococci have occurred. Higher concentrations of cipro -
floxacin have been achieved by adding drug to the dialysate (20–50 µg/
mL), with outcomes similar to those with standard regimens of 
intraperitoneal vancomycin plus gentamicin.254 Oral regimens may have 
been less effective due to binding of fluoroquinolones to oral phosphate 
binders, which reduce their bioavailability. A combination of intraperi -
toneal ciprofloxacin (50  mg/L) and rifampin (50 mg/L) produced a 65% 
cure rate, which was superior to that with intraperitoneal cephradine.255 
When intraperitoneal vancomycin was used, oral levofloxacin was inferior 
to an intraperitoneal aminoglycoside in patients with gram-negative 
CAPD infections, a limitation that appeared to be related to the prevalence 
of levofloxacin resistance in these organisms.256 Current International 
Society for Peritoneal Dialysis guidelines recommend oral treatment 
for peritonitis due to susceptible bacteria with the following quinolones: 
ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily), levofloxacin (250 mg once daily), 
moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily), and intraperitoneal administration 
of ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin.257
In treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients, 
ciprofloxacin has been compared with cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or 
ceftazidime; ofloxacin has been compared with cefotaxime; and moxi -
floxacin has been compared with amoxicillin-clavulanate.258 With 35 
to 123 patients in these studies, no differences in clinical outcomes were 
found. In patients with cirrhosis at high risk for recurrent spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis, norfloxacin, 400 mg once daily given as prophylaxis, 
reduced recurrences by threefold.259 Norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were 
also studied for up to 1 year for the primary prophylaxis of spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis among high-risk patients with low ascitic protein 
concentration.260–264 A trend toward a reduced number of episodes of 
peritonitis was observed in all studies, and in a few, a notable increased 
probability of survival was also found. Prolonged use of norfloxacin 
was, however, later associated with increasing occurrence of quinolone-
resistant bacteria263,265; in this respect, it is interesting that the survival 
advantage was substantial at 3 months (94% vs. 62%; P = .003) but only 
60% versus 48% by 1 year ( P = .05).261 Patients who have been on this 
prophylaxis and develop peritonitis should be treated with agents other 
than a fluoroquinolone because the risk of quinolone resistance is high 
in this group.266 Similarly, primary prophylaxis had also been recom -
mended for patients with cirrhosis and gastrointestinal bleeding because 
in several studies, performed in the 1990s, that tested mainly quinolones, 
prophylaxis was efficacious in reducing the number of deaths and bacterial 
infections.267 In a more recent study,261 however, oral norfloxacin and 
intravenous ceftriaxone were compared for prophylaxis in 111 cirrhotic 
patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Spontaneous bacteremia or 
bacterial peritonitis was significantly higher in patients receiving 
norfloxacin.268 Thus the risks of selecting resistant enteric bacteria must 
also be considered before embarking on prolonged use of quinolones 
in prophylaxis.
Respiratory Tract Infections
A range of respiratory tract pathogens is susceptible to a number of 
quinolones in vitro. Haemophilus influenzae, M. catarrhalis,  and many 
enteric gram-negative bacilli, as well as the agents of atypical 
pneumonias— M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae,  and L. pneumophila —are 
generally susceptible to systemic quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, 
ofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and delafloxacin. 
High intracellular concentrations of quinolones are likely advantageous 
for intracellular pathogens, such as L. pneumophila  and M. tuberculosis.  
Levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and delafloxacin have improved 
activity against S. pneumoniae  and have been referred to as respiratory 
quinolones.
Patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis 
have been treated with many different quinolones, which have generally 
been effective in eradicating H. influenzae  from sputum.269 In studies 
with ciprofloxacin, eradication rates for S. pneumoniae  and P . aeruginosa  
were lower, and some failures have been associated with the development also failed to meet the expectation to be a better alternative for Salmonella  
infections with increased MICs to fluoroquinolones. Two studies were 
conducted in Nepal in adults and children with uncomplicated enteric 
fever. In one, 7 days of gatifloxacin or ofloxacin among 170 patients 
infected by nalidixic acid–resistant isolates were equally effective.229 In 
another study, performed in a background of increasing fluoroquinolone 
resistance, 7 days of gatifloxacin (10 mg/kg/day) was inferior to ceftri -
axone among microbiologically confirmed cases.230 Chronic fecal carriage 
of fluoroquinolone-susceptible S. enterica  serovar Typhi has been 
eradicated in 83% to 93% of small numbers of patients, including a few 
with gallstones, given norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or ofloxacin for 4 
weeks.223,231,232
Quinolones are active against H. pylori  in vitro. Several randomized 
comparative trials have demonstrated that levofloxacin- and moxifloxacin-
based multidrug regimens administered for 7 to 10 days were effective 
in eradication of H. pylori.  The eradication rate was approximately 80%, 
similar to other standard non–fluoroquinolone-containing multidrug 
regimens.233–239 The presence of quinolone resistance, however, signifi -
cantly decreased the eradication rate.240 Current guidelines recognize 
that antibiotic resistance should be addressed when choosing treatment 
regimens for H. pylori  and do not recommend inclusion of fluoroqui -
nolones in first-line regimens or their repeated use.241,242
Data are quite limited on the use of quinolones for treatment of 
biliary tract infections. In a single small study, 83% of patients with 
cholecystitis and cholangitis, most associated with E. coli  bacteremia, 
responded to intravenous and then oral ciprofloxacin.243 In patients 
with biliary stents, late blockage has been thought to be due in part to 
bacterial adherence to the stent with biofilm formation. In small studies, 
ciprofloxacin (250 mg PO twice daily) and ofloxacin (200 mg twice 
daily) were not shown to delay stent blockage.244,245
In patients with complicated intraabdominal infections caused by 
disruption of the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract, a mixture of 
anaerobes and facultative gram-negative aerobes, with or without 
enterococci, are usually involved. In a randomized, double-blind trial, 
ciprofloxacin (400 mg IV every 12 hours/500 mg PO every 12 hours) 
plus metronidazole (500 mg IV/PO every 6 hours) was compared with 
imipenem (500 mg every 6 hours) for patients with complicated infections 
largely caused by disease of the colon, small bowel, and appendix. 
Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were given either entirely intravenously 
or with a switch to oral administration after initial response. Clinical 
outcomes were similar in all three arms of the study. Regardless of 
treatment, however, there was a significantly higher rate of treatment 
failure if enterococci were isolated from the site of infection (28%) than 
if they were not (14%),246 suggesting that additional agents active against 
enterococci should be considered if culture results dictate. Ciprofloxacin 
plus metronidazole also appeared superior to piperacillin-tazobactam 
in another double-blind trial, although analysis of treatment failures 
was incomplete,247,248 and another study found no differences when 
ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole was compared with ceftriaxone plus 
metronidazole.249
Moxifloxacin, which has activity against enteric gram-negative bacilli 
similar to that of ciprofloxacin and additional activity against anaerobic 
bacteria, was studied in double-blind randomized trials as a single agent 
(400 mg IV/PO once daily) in comparison to piperacillin-tazobactam 
(3.75 g IV every 6 hours) followed by amoxicillin-clavulanate (914 mg 
PO every 12 hours), both regimens given for up to 14 days,250 and in 
comparison to ceftriaxone (2 g IV once daily) plus metronidazole (500 mg 
IV twice daily) given for 3 to 14 days.251 In the first study, clinical cure 
rates were 80% and 78% in the two arms, respectively. In the second 
study, although clinical response rates for moxifloxacin met the non -
inferiority criteria, they were significantly lower than in the ceftriaxone-
metronidazole arm (90.2% vs. 96.5%).251 The high rates of response in 
both studies would be expected because of the low overall Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores of the 
enrolled patients. High rates of susceptibility to moxifloxacin among 
baseline anaerobic isolates (87%) were found overall in these and related 
moxifloxacin intraabdominal infection trials.252 Current IDSA guidelines 
for intraabdominal infections include moxifloxacin alone and combina -
tions of either ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin with metronidazole among 
recommended regimens for initial therapy.253

(IV/PO) with or without clarithromycin, with more rapid defervescence, 
higher rates of clinical success (93% vs. 85%), and higher rates of bacterial 
eradication from sputum (94% vs. 82%).307 For hospitalized patients 
older than 65 years, moxifloxacin (400 mg IV/PO once daily) produced 
a trend toward slightly better overall clinical outcomes than levofloxacin 
(500 mg IV/PO once daily), with a higher proportion of patients with 
clinical recovery by days 3 to 5.309 No studies have compared moxifloxacin 
with the higher dose of levofloxacin. Gemifloxacin (320 mg PO once 
daily) produced modestly better clinical success in comparison to 
trovafloxacin (200 mg PO once daily) in an intent-to-treat analysis (88% 
vs. 81%), with similar responses in the per-protocol analysis (96% vs. 
94%).308
Clinical responses in the subgroups of patients (usually numbering 
10–20 patients) with pneumococci isolated from sputum from various 
trials were usually similar to the overall response rates (levofloxacin, 
81%–100%292; moxifloxacin, 100%299,307; and gemifloxacin 90%–100%).304,308 
Most studies have included patients with mild-to-moderate pneumonia, 
but those with levofloxacin and gemifloxacin304 included patients with 
severe pneumonia by using clinical criteria similar to those used for 
stratification of risk of death,310 with 91% and 87% clinical cures, 
respectively. Outcomes in patients with pneumococcal bacteremia 
and pneumonia, a more severe test of drug efficacy, were good overall 
with levofloxacin (91%, 107 of 117 cured),291,311 moxifloxacin (88%, 
21 of 24 cured; and 70%, 7 of 10 cured),301,302,307,312 and gemifloxacin 
(100%, 12 of 12 cured).304 Clinical failures associated with prior or 
acquired quinolone resistance in pneumococci have been reported with 
levofloxacin therapy but have not yet been reported in association with 
the less extensive use of moxifloxacin or gemifloxacin.313 In light of 
the high selection pressure for resistance imposed by broad-spectrum 
combination therapy for community-acquired pneumonia, a recent 
study from the Netherlands evaluated the paradigm of combining 
β-lactams with fluoroquinolones or macrolides.314 The mortality 
difference between the β-lactam strategy and the fluoroquinolone 
strategy was in favor of the fluoroquinolone strategy, but was not 
statistically significant, and no differences were found in other secondary  
outcomes.
In aspiration pneumonia and lung abscess, coverage for oral anaerobic 
bacteria is generally important. Moxifloxacin, relative to other fluoro -
quinolones, exhibits enhanced activity in vitro against anaerobic bacteria 
and, at 400 mg intravenously/orally once daily, produced similar clinical 
responses compared with ampicillin-sulbactam (2 g/1 g IV three times 
daily), followed by sultamicillin (750 mg PO twice daily), in treatment 
of patients with aspiration pneumonia (32 of 48 [67%] in both groups) 
or lung abscess (15 of 19 [79%] vs. 11 of 15 [73%]).315
Among atypical pneumonias, smaller numbers of patients with 
pneumonias caused by Legionella,316,317 Mycoplasma,79 and C. pneu -
moniae318 have also responded to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but some 
apparent failures were seen in patients with M. pneumoniae  and C. 
pneumoniae  infection treated with ofloxacin.289 Clinical responses to 
levofloxacin,291 moxifloxacin,307,319 and gemifloxacin304,306,310 in usually 
small numbers (except for the larger number in the trial of gemifloxa -
cin310) of patients with C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae,  and L. pneu -
mophila  infection, usually diagnosed serologically, have generally been 
high. In observational studies, patients with Legionella  pneumonia had 
similar or better clinical responses to levofloxacin relative to macro -
lides.320,321 With pneumonia caused by other atypical pathogens—
particularly with M. pneumoniae  infections, which may improve without 
treatment—assessment of responses is difficult because study designs 
often do not compare the rapidity of symptomatic improvement between 
active and inactive agents. Respiratory quinolones appear to be at least 
as good as if not superior to macrolides for treatment of Legionella  
pneumonia.322
Hospital-acquired pneumonias, which are commonly caused by 
gram-negative bacilli, have responded to intravenous ciprofloxacin143,323 
and ofloxacin,288 and responses to ciprofloxacin correlated with the level 
of susceptibility of the infecting organism, with better bacteriologic 
responses in infections caused by Haemophilus  spp. and members of 
the Enterobacteriaceae than in infections caused by the less susceptible 
P . aeruginosa.  Comparative trials of imipenem versus ciprofloxacin324 of bacterial resistance. In comparative trials with respiratory quinolones, 
however, clinical responses have usually been similar to or better than 
those with ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefaclor, and macrolides.270 Clinical 
and microbiologic outcomes were similar for levofloxacin (500 mg once 
daily) versus cefuroxime axetil271–273; moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily) 
versus clarithromycin,274,275 azithromycin,276,277 levofloxacin,278 or a new 
quinolone, zabofloxacin279; and gemifloxacin (320 mg once daily) versus 
clarithromycin280 or levofloxacin.281 Five- or 7-day courses seemed to 
be sufficient, with clinical response rates of 85% to 95%, and 5- and 
10-day courses of moxifloxacin were comparable to each other (94% 
responses).275
Moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin were superior to clarithromycin in 
eradicating H. influenzae  from sputum, probably because of the lesser 
activity of clarithromycin against this organism.274,278 In a double-blind, 
randomized study of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic 
bronchitis, characterized by dypsnea and increased volume of purulent 
sputum, moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily for 5 days) was superior to 
standard therapies (7 days of amoxicillin, 500 mg three times daily; 
clarithromycin, 500 mg twice daily; or cefuroxime axetil, 250 mg twice 
daily) in clinical cure and bacteriologic eradication.282 In a study of 
more severely ill, hospitalized patients with acute exacerbations of chronic 
bronchitis, gemifloxacin (320 mg PO once daily for 5 days) had better 
clinical responses in the intent-to-treat analysis and a shorter time to 
hospital discharge relative to ceftriaxone (1 g IV once daily for ≤3 days), 
followed by cefuroxime axetil (500 mg PO twice daily for ≤7 days).283 
Time to next recurrent exacerbation was lengthened after treatment 
with ciprofloxacin versus clarithromycin284 but was comparable to that 
after treatment with cefuroxime axetil,285 and average infection-free 
intervals were similar in both comparisons. Moxifloxacin treatment 
was associated with a significant 13% to 27% increase in the time to 
next exacerbation relative to conventional therapies with amoxicillin, 
clarithromycin, or cefuroxime,282 and the proportion of patients without 
a recurrence after treatment of an exacerbation with gemifloxacin was 
significantly lower than that after treatment with clarithromycin (71% 
vs. 58%, respectively, at 26 weeks).280 Repeated courses of moxifloxacin 
(5 days every month) in patients with stable chronic obstructive pul -
monary disease were, however, similar to placebo in reduction in bacterial 
load, and had more treatment-related adverse events.286
In patients with community-acquired pneumonias, ciprofloxacin 
and ofloxacin have consistently eradicated H. influenzae  and M. 
catarrhalis.79 Although cures of pneumococcal pneumonias, including 
a few cases with bacteremia, have been reported with intravenous and 
then oral ciprofloxacin287 and ofloxacin288,289 and with oral ofloxacin 
alone,290 failures with both drugs have occurred, and pneumococcal 
bacteremia has developed during ciprofloxacin therapy of pneumonia.143 
For this reason, ciprofloxacin is generally not used to treat lower respira -
tory infections, with the exception that it is recommended as part of a 
combination regimen for treatment of inhalational anthrax (see “ Skin 
and Soft Tissue Infections ”). For respiratory quinolones with greater 
pneumococcal activity, similar or better clinical and microbiologic 
efficacies have been found for levofloxacin (500 mg IV/PO once daily) 
versus ceftriaxone (with or without erythromycin), followed by cefu -
roxime axetil,291 ceftriaxone alone,292 amoxicillin-clavulanate alone or 
together with clarithromycin, and solithromycin or tigecycline.293–296 
Five days of a higher-dose regimen of levofloxacin (750 mg once daily) 
was comparable in clinical success to 10 days of the lower dose (500 mg 
once daily),297 with a higher proportion of patients with resolution of 
fever and purulent sputum by day 3.298 Comparable outcomes with 
generally high cure rates have also been seen in comparisons of moxi -
floxacin (400 mg PO once daily) versus clarithromycin,299 ceftriaxone 
plus levofloxacin,300 solithromycin (PO and IV-to-PO),301,302 or amoxicil -
lin303 and comparisons of gemifloxacin (320 mg PO once daily) versus 
ceftriaxone, followed by cefuroxime axetil,304 or versus amoxicillin-
clavulanate.305 A 5-day course of gemifloxacin also appeared to be 
comparable to a 7-day course.306
In addition to the initial study with levofloxacin,291 a few studies, 
including one with moxifloxacin307 and another with gemifloxacin,308 
have also demonstrated superiority relative to the comparator agents 
in treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. In 
hospitalized patients requiring initial parenteral therapy, moxifloxacin

Acute purulent sinusitis acquired in the community is often caused 
by a similar group of pathogens to those that cause acute bacterial 
exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and may be seen as a complication 
of viral upper respiratory infections. Anaerobic bacteria are usually 
present in only a small percentage of patients and are more likely if 
sinusitis is chronic or associated with dental infections. Establishment 
of drainage of the infected sinus cavity by use of nasal decongestants 
or other means is an important adjunctive therapy in addition to 
antimicrobial agents. There are a number of trials comparing quinolones 
with other therapies in patients with acute purulent sinusitis, including 
ciprofloxacin (500 mg PO twice daily) versus cefuroxime axetil,331a 
levofloxacin (500 mg PO once daily) versus amoxicillin-clavulanate331b 
or clarithromycin,331c and moxifloxacin (400 mg PO once daily) versus 
cefuroxime axetil331d,332 or amoxicillin-clavulanate.331e In all of these 
studies, there were comparable clinical responses between the quinolone 
and its comparator, with generally high response rates (87% to 96%). 
A 5-day course of levofloxacin at the higher dose (750 mg once daily) 
was also comparable to a 10-day course at the lower dose (500 mg once 
daily).331f In these or other studies in which microbiologic samples were 
obtained by sinus puncture or nasal endoscopy before therapy, H. 
influenzae  and S. pneumoniae  were the predominant pathogens, and 
clinical responses in the subset of patients from whom S. pneumoniae  
was isolated were high: 100% for levofloxacin331f and 97% for moxi -
floxacin.332 Thus these quinolones may be an alternative to, but offer 
no advantage over, nonquinolone therapies for treatment of acute 
community-acquired purulent sinusitis. A prospective, multicenter, 
randomized, double-blind trial compared the efficacy and safety of 
moxifloxacin (400  mg daily for 5 days) versus placebo in the treatment 
of culture-positive acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.333 Interestingly, 
moxifloxacin was not significantly superior to placebo for the primary 
end point.
Although acute otitis media is caused by pathogens similar to those 
that cause acute bacterial sinusitis, fluoroquinolones have not been 
widely used because acute otitis media is usually a disease of children, 
in whom joint toxicity of fluoroquinolones had been a concern. Invasive 
otitis externa in diabetics is usually caused by P . aeruginosa  and may 
respond to oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice daily) given for 6 weeks.334,335 
No studies comparing quinolones with conventional parenteral therapies 
in adults have been reported.
Bone and Joint Infections
The prolonged antimicrobial therapy usually given for bone and joint 
infections is facilitated by effective oral agents, and quinolones may fill 
this role in some cases.336 For treatment of chronic osteomyelitis, there 
have been noncomparative trials using ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, 
or levofloxacin, in which treatment was usually for 6 or more weeks 
and follow-up was for at least 6 months after completion of 
therapy.79,143,337,338 Clinical cures after oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice 
daily) were 75% overall in infections in which gram-negative bacilli 
predominated, and similar rates of cure were reported in the smaller 
subgroups of patients with P . aeruginosa  and methicillin-susceptible S. 
aureus  (MSSA) infections. Failures were associated with incomplete 
débridement, the presence of foreign bodies, and the development of 
resistance in P . aeruginosa, S. aureus,  and Serratia marcescens.  Levo -
floxacin (500 mg once daily) was effective in 9 of 15 patients (60%), 
with largely polymicrobial ( S. aureus  in 7 and P . aeruginosa  in 3; all but 
3 had other organisms as well) infections; in 4 cases, failures were 
thought to be due to inadequate débridement.337 Three months of 
treatment with ciprofloxacin produced a cure rate of 60% in one study 
of osteomyelitis in the feet of diabetics339; ofloxacin produced a similar 
response rate.340 Calcaneal osteochondritis caused by nail puncture 
wounds of the foot is often due to P . aeruginosa.  Local débridement in 
combination with ciprofloxacin (400  mg IV every 12 hours, then 750  mg 
PO twice daily) given for 14 days appears to be highly effective for this 
condition, with cures in all 18 patients with P . aeruginosa  infection and 
in 2 with S. aureus  infection.341
In four small comparative trials, ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice daily) 
and ofloxacin (400 mg twice daily) have generally produced apparent 
rates of cure similar to those of conventional parenteral therapies using 
β-lactams with or without an aminoglycoside,143,342 but the power of or levofloxacin325 for treatment of patients with nosocomial pneumonia 
have been published. For hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia, 
ciprofloxacin in high dose (400 mg IV every 8 hours) was compared 
with imipenem (1000 mg IV every 8 hours) in a multicenter, randomized, 
double-blind trial.324 Most of the patients had nosocomial pneumonia 
(78%) and were mechanically ventilated (79%). Clinical and microbiologic 
response rates were somewhat higher in the ciprofloxacin (69% and 
69%, respectively) than the imipenem (56% and 59%, respectively) 
group, and bacterial eradication rates were highest for members of the 
Enterobacteriaceae. Substantially poorer responses in both treatment 
groups were seen in patients with P . aeruginosa  infection, and for both 
P . aeruginosa  and S. aureus,  persistence in sputum was substantial (60% 
to 67% and 35% of patients, respectively) and was associated with 
development of resistance. For these reasons, combination therapy and 
use of maximum approved doses of ciprofloxacin (750 mg PO or 400 mg 
IV every 8–12 hours) may be preferred when ciprofloxacin is used in 
patients with P . aeruginosa  infection. Addition of ciprofloxacin to 
meropenem did not provide additional clinical benefit over meropenem 
alone overall in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, but in 
the subset of patients with P . aeruginosa, Acinetobacter  spp., or multidrug-
resistant gram-negative bacilli, bacteriologic eradication was higher in 
the combination therapy group.326 In a multicenter, randomized, open-
label trial, high-dose levofloxacin (750 mg IV/PO) produced clinical 
responses similar to those with imipenem (500 mg to 1 g every 6–12 
hours), followed by ciprofloxacin (750 mg PO every 12 hours), when 
both regimens were given for 7 to 15 days (135 of 204 patients [66%] 
vs. 143 of 206 patients [69%] in intent-to-treat analysis), including a 
severely ill subset of patients with APACHE II scores less than 20 (mean 
APACHE II scores were 15.0 vs. 14.8).325 A later analysis of the subgroup 
of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia also found similar 
efficacy in the two treatment groups.327 Patients also received additional 
therapy if they had documented infection with methicillin-resistant S. 
aureus  (vancomycin for both study arms) or P . aeruginosa  (ceftazidime 
for levofloxacin arm and amikacin for imipenem arm). Microbiologic 
eradication rates were also similar overall. In patients with P . aeruginosa  
infection, however, there was a trend toward better clinical and micro -
biologic responses in the levofloxacin arm, suggesting that levofloxacin 
plus ceftazidime might be somewhat better than imipenem plus amikacin 
for these infections. No data were included about emergence of bacterial 
resistance in this study, but prior exposure to levofloxacin has been 
associated with the emergence of resistance in P . aeruginosa.328 Recent 
IDSA guidelines for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-
associated pneumonia have limited the role of combination therapy to 
the setting of definite therapy of infection with P . aeruginosa  in patients 
who remain in septic shock or at a high risk for death.329
There has been a single reported study of moxifloxacin (400 mg IV/
PO once daily) in treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia in patients 
who were screened to exclude clinical risk factors for resistant pathogens. 
The study was terminated early because of slow enrollment and had 
identified no differences in outcomes relative to ceftriaxone, followed 
by cefuroxime.330
Mild-to-moderate respiratory exacerbations in patients with cystic 
fibrosis and P . aeruginosa  in sputum responded clinically to oral cip -
rofloxacin (750 mg twice daily) and ofloxacin (400 mg twice daily), and 
similarly to conventional parenteral therapies that use an antipseudomonal 
β-lactam and tobramycin.143 In patients with more severe exacerbations, 
however, conventional parenteral combination therapy may be superior. 
Rarely is P . aeruginosa  eliminated from sputum by any regimen in patients 
with cystic fibrosis. Rotating the use of different regimens may reduce 
the selective pressure for persistence of resistant bacteria that may emerge 
with either type of regimen. Levofloxacin inhalation solution is an 
aerosolized fluoroquinolone licensed for treatment and maintenance 
therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic P . aeruginosa  lung 
infections. In a randomized noninferiority study, levofloxacin inhalation 
solution (three 28-day on/off cycles) was noninferior to the same regimen 
with inhalational tobramycin. Levofloxacin inhalation solution was well 
tolerated, with dysgeusia (distorted taste) as the most frequent adverse 
event; a greater than fourfold increase in MIC of levofloxacin was 
observed in 21% of the P . aeruginosa  isolates, similar to the comparator 
group.331

ofloxacin, cures of MSSA infections were 80% (10 of 12), but cures of 
P . aeruginosa  infections were only 25% (1 of 4).342 For patients with 
spinal brucellosis, ciprofloxacin (500 mg PO twice daily) plus rifampin 
(600 mg PO once daily) produced cure rates similar to doxycycline 
plus streptomycin given for 12 to 24 weeks when compared in consecutive, 
nonrandomized groups.343 Randomized, controlled studies do not, 
however, provide support for the use of quinolone-based combinations 
as a first-line therapy, and quinolone-based regimens were associated 
with a higher relapse rate than comparators.344
For septic arthritis of prosthetic joints, standard therapy involves 
staged prosthesis removal and débridement, prolonged antibiotic 
treatment, and prosthesis reimplantation. Infections of prosthetic joints 
caused by S. aureus  and coagulase-negative staphylococci have been 
treated with ofloxacin (200 mg PO three times daily) plus rifampin 
(900 mg once daily) for 6 to 9 months using the standard approach 
as well as débridement with retention of the prosthesis in patients for 
whom removal was not possible.345 With prolonged follow-up after 
completion of therapy, response rates were high in patients after the 
standard approach (81%–93%) and unexpectedly high in the patients 
with retained prostheses (54%–70%). Similar results have been reported 
for ciprofloxacin plus rifampin that also document the importance of 
rifampin in the antimicrobial regimen, because failure rates were high 
when ciprofloxacin was used alone.346 Ceftazidime (1.5 g every 12 hours) 
given for 6 weeks plus ciprofloxacin (500 mg PO every 8 hours) given for 6 
months also appeared to cure P . aeruginosa –infected orthopedic implants 
without prosthesis removal.347 Patients with infections of prosthetic joints 
caused primarily by staphylococci have also been successfully treated 
with a combination of levofloxacin (500 mg PO once daily) and rifampin 
(600 mg once daily) given for extended periods after débridement with 
prosthesis retention.348,349 A randomized comparison of short (8 weeks) 
and long (3–6 months) durations of treatment with levofloxacin at a 
higher dose (750 mg PO once daily) and rifampin (600 mg daily) found 
that at a median of 540 days of follow-up, the short course was no worse 
than the long course in 63 patients with staphylococcal prosthetic joint 
infection after débridement and prosthesis retention (73% vs. 58% cure 
in intent-to-treat analysis and 92% vs. 95% in per-protocol analysis 
for short and long durations, respectively).350 For patients with rigid 
internal fixation devices (plates and screws) infected by staphylococci 
that were débrided and retained, a levofloxacin-rifampin regimen resulted 
in an overall cure rate of 72%.351 For patients with either prostheses or 
internal fixation devices, failures were associated with a longer duration 
of symptoms before débridement.348,351 Thus, for salvage of some patients 
in whom orthopedic devices cannot be removed, early débridement 
and extended treatment with a combination of a fluoroquinolone and 
rifampin (or ceftazidime) could be considered if the infecting organism 
is susceptible to both agents in the combination.
There are few other data on treatment of septic arthritis with qui -
nolones, most often with ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin.79 Infections caused 
by N. gonorrhoeae  and E. coli  have responded to oral therapy. Failures 
have been seen in infections of prosthetic joints and infections caused 
by S. aureus  and P . aeruginosa  infections.
Skin and Soft Tissue Infections
Although the most common causes of cellulitis and pyodermas are 
streptococci and S. aureus,  in patients with diabetes and peripheral 
vascular disease, decubitus ulcers, and some surgical wound infections, 
soft tissues may become infected with a mixture of bacteria that includes, 
in addition to streptococci and staphylococci, aerobic gram-negative 
bacteria and anaerobes. Quinolones have been evaluated as treatment 
for skin and soft tissue infections in some of these subgroups of 
patients.352,353
For uncomplicated skin infections, comparable clinical response 
rates (usually 90% or higher in both arms) have been reported for 
ofloxacin (400 mg PO twice daily) versus cephalexin (500 mg four times 
daily),354 levofloxacin (500 mg PO once daily) versus ciprofloxacin 
(500 mg PO twice daily),355 and moxifloxacin (400 mg PO once daily) 
versus cephalexin (500 mg three times daily).356 Staphylococcus aureus  
and Streptococcus pyogenes  were the dominant pathogens in these studies, 
but methicillin-resistant S. aureus  (MRSA) strains, which are commonly also resistant to quinolones, were infrequently reported. Levofloxacin 
was significantly better than ciprofloxacin in eradicating S. aureus  in 
one study.355 In these and noncomparative studies,79 failures have been 
seen with infections caused by P . aeruginosa  (11%), streptococci (6%), 
and S. aureus  (5%) and have been associated with the development of 
resistant organisms, which for P . aeruginosa  may be more frequent in 
diabetic patients.354
For complicated skin infections, comparisons of oral ciprofloxacin 
(750 mg twice daily)357,358 and ofloxacin (400 mg twice daily)359 with 
intravenous cefotaxime or ceftazidime, given for 9 to 12 days to patients 
with mixed infections in which gram-negative bacilli predominated, 
showed similar rates of clinical and bacteriologic efficacy, in the range 
of 79% to 98% clinical cures. Staphylococcus aureus  and P . aeruginosa  
were the most common pathogens in these studies, with few MRSA 
strains identified. Levofloxacin (750 mg IV/PO once daily) compared 
with ticarcillin-clavulanate (3.1 g IV every 4 to 6 hours), followed by 
amoxicillin-clavulanate (875 mg PO every 12 hours), produced similar 
overall clinical success (116 of 138 patients [84%] vs. 106 of 132 patients 
[80%]).360 Levofloxacin was superior in eradicating MSSA, the dominant 
pathogen, and similar in eradicating a mix of gram-negative pathogens. 
The subgroup with diabetic foot infections was too small to assess 
adequately. In diabetic foot infections without osteomyelitis, the overall 
rate for complete healing using ciprofloxacin alone was 50%.339 The 
polymicrobial nature of these infections, which may include anaerobes, 
may be a limiting factor for efficacy of some fluoroquinolones. Use of 
additional antimicrobial agents with activity against anaerobes should 
be considered in these patients. In a double-blind, randomized trial, 
moxifloxacin (400 mg IV/PO once daily) produced comparable clinical 
responses and bacterial eradication rates relative to piperacillin-
tazobactam (3.375 g IV every 6 hours), followed by amoxicillin-
clavulanate, in patients with dominant cellulitis or skin abscess.361 In 
the subgroups of patients in whom S. aureus  (only a minority were 
MRSA), S. pyogenes,  and enteric gram-negative bacteria were isolated 
and in the subgroup of diabetic foot infections, clinical response rates 
were also similar. In a randomized, double-blind trial, delafloxacin 
(300 mg IV) was compared to linezolid (600 mg IV) and vancomycin 
(15 mg/kg IV) each given twice daily in 256 patients with acute bacterial 
skin and skin structure infections.362 Staphylococcus aureus  was the 
dominant pathogen identified, with MRSA exceeding MSSA, and cellulitis 
(~45%) and major abscess (~28%) were the dominant infection types. 
Delafloxacin was significantly better than vancomycin in clinical cure 
(57 of 81 patients [70%] vs. 53 of 98 patients [54%]) and in reduction 
of local erythema, with no significant differences between delafloxacin 
and linezolid. In a phase 3, double-blind, randomized trial, delafloxacin 
was also shown to be noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 
similar objective reductions in erythema (78% vs. 81%), rates of clinical 
cure (70% vs. 67%), and eradication of MRSA (100% vs. 98%).363
The role of quinolones in the treatment of cutaneous and other 
forms of anthrax received considerable attention as a result of bioterrorism 
cases of anthrax in the United States in 2001. Activity in vitro is excellent 
for a number of fluoroquinolones, and ciprofloxacin (500 mg PO twice 
daily) is the recommended regimen for cutaneous disease and prophylaxis 
after exposure to anthrax spores.364 Inhalational anthrax is treated with 
intravenous ciprofloxacin in combination with other agents.
For patients with uncomplicated cellulitis or pyodermas, in whom 
streptococci and staphylococci are the most likely pathogens, respectively, 
conventional therapies with penicillin, semisynthetic penicillins, and 
cephalosporins, either oral or parenteral, remain the therapy of choice. 
For infections with MRSA, for which the quinolones were initially hoped 
to be valuable oral therapies, rapid emergence of quinolone resistance 
has become a particular problem, and resistance is now highly prevalent 
in many medical centers.365,366 In addition, with the increasing frequency 
of MRSA as a cause of skin infections in the community and the 
emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in community strains (along 
with established resistance in hospital strains),367 fluoroquinolones cannot 
be relied on overall for empirical therapy of serious skin infections 
possibly caused by staphylococci. The exception appears to be dela -
floxacin, which has in vitro activity against MRSA, and for which efficacy 
has been shown in MRSA skin infections in initial clinical trials. It 
remains important to confirm the proper choice of antimicrobial by

(600 mg once daily) given for 28 days produced clinical improvements 
comparable to dapsone (100 mg once daily) plus rifampin (600 mg 
every month) given for 6 months.389
For patients with bacteremias, intravenous ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin 
have been effective in cases caused by enteric gram-negative bacilli, 
although responses have been poor for P . aeruginosa  bacteremias when 
these drugs were used in relatively low doses of 200 mg twice daily.390,391 
In neutropenic patients with fever, ciprofloxacin in combination with 
aminoglycosides produced defervescence and cure of documented 
infections comparable to standard β-lactam–aminoglycoside combina -
tions,392 but ciprofloxacin monotherapy was less effective than such 
combinations393 and should not be used. Although lower doses were 
used in earlier studies, more recent studies have used regimens of 
ciprofloxacin (400 mg IV every 8 hours; in one case, followed by 750 mg 
PO twice daily), either alone394 or in combination with piperacillin.395 
Ciprofloxacin alone was comparable to ceftazidime plus amikacin, and 
ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin was comparable to tobramycin plus 
piperacillin in resolution of fever, but changes in therapy were necessary 
in more than half of patients in both arms of both studies. Use of 
quinolones in this setting should be cautious and should be considered 
principally as an alternative regimen when there are reasons for not 
choosing standard regimens with combinations of β-lactams and 
aminoglycosides.
There has been an increase in interest in defining low-risk groups 
of neutropenic patients who might be safe candidates for oral antimi -
crobial therapy for fever because of the potential for increased convenience 
and reduced costs. Quinolones have been components of such oral 
regimens.396,397 These trials evaluated a combination of oral ciprofloxacin 
and amoxicillin-clavulanate compared with intravenous ceftazidime in 
one trial397 and with intravenous ceftriaxone plus amikacin in the other.396 
The trials involved patients with fever and neutropenia from cancer 
chemotherapy and who were able to take oral medications and were 
considered to have low risk of serious complications, based on the 
absence of other diseases and documented infection and a projected 
duration of neutropenia of less than 10 days. Success of treatment in 
patients given the oral and parenteral regimens was similar in both 
studies, although the oral regimen was associated unexpectedly with a 
higher incidence of adverse effects (16% vs. 1%, respectively), largely 
nausea and vomiting.397 Renal failure reported in an earlier trial of 
ciprofloxacin plus clindamycin for treatment of a similar group of patients 
was not seen in these trials.398 In a double-blind, randomized trial, 
moxifloxacin (400 mg PO daily) alone was similar to ciprofloxacin 
(750 mg twice daily) plus amoxicillin-clavulanate in clinical response 
(80% vs. 82%).399 Guidelines of the IDSA recommend that febrile 
neutropenic patients with low risk, defined as anticipated neutropenia 
for less than or equal to 7 days and no or few comorbidities, are candidates 
for oral therapy with a regimen of ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin plus 
amoxicillin-clavulanate.400
Oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily), ofloxacin (300 mg twice 
daily), and norfloxacin (400 mg twice daily), given as prophylaxis in 
neutropenic patients, have consistently reduced the occurrence of 
gram-negative bacteremia and, in some cases, prolonged the time to 
first fever, but breakthrough gram-positive bacteremias have occurred, 
particularly streptococcal bacteremias in bone marrow transplant 
recipients.401,402 Ciprofloxacin (20 mg/kg/day) compared to placebo 
reduced febrile episodes in neutropenic pediatric patients during the 
acute induction phase but not the consolidation phase of chemotherapy 
for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and was associated with increased 
stool colonization with ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli  and K. pneu -
moniae.403 Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin appear superior to norfloxacin,404,405 
with lower rates of gram-negative and, in the case of ofloxacin, streptococ -
cal bacteremias. Addition of penicillin to norfloxacin reduced break -
through streptococcal bacteremias,406 and addition of rifampin to 
ofloxacin reduced staphylococcal bacteremias.405 Colonization and 
breakthrough bacteremias with quinolone-resistant viridans streptococci 
have also been reported when levofloxacin was used alone as prophylaxis 
in recipients of autologous stem cell transplants and hematologic 
malignancies.407,408 Use of additional agents with activity against gram-
positive pathogens in combination with fluoroquinolones in prophylaxis 
can reduce gram-positive bacteremias but is less well tolerated.409,410 In isolation and susceptibility testing of the relevant pathogen when 
possible.
Other Uses
Because of resistance to conventional antituberculosis agents, quinolones 
are being used for treatment of mycobacterial infections.368 In patients 
with multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis, ofloxacin (300 or 
800 mg once daily) has been used in combination with other second-line 
agents, with sputum conversions and apparent clinical cures,369 but in 
cases in which ofloxacin was the only active drug, there was failure of 
sputum conversion and development of ofloxacin resistance.369,370 
Ciprofloxacin (750 mg PO once daily) is less effective in combination 
regimens than are other first-line agents.371,372 Levofloxacin and moxi -
floxacin, however, are being used in second-line regimens for treatment 
of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. For early bactericidal activity against 
M. tuberculosis  in sputum, levofloxacin (1 g once daily) and moxifloxacin 
(400 mg once daily) were similar to isoniazid (300 mg once daily).373 
Moxifloxacin (400 mg) was comparable to ethambutol as the fourth 
component of a regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 
sputum conversion within the first 2 months of therapy, with no difference 
between dosing 5 days per week versus 3 days per week, after the first 
2 weeks of daily therapy.374 A later study, however, in which almost all 
patients had lung cavities found that moxifloxacin versus ethambutol, 
in a four-drug regimen, was associated with accelerated reduction in 
viable bacilli in sputum when adjusted for patient factors that affect 
rate of sputum conversion.375 Three recent randomized controlled trials 
compared standard 6-month regimens with quinolone-containing 
4-month regimens in the treatment of rifampin-sensitive pulmonary 
tuberculosis, but all three studies failed to show noninferiority of the 
quinolone-containing regimen.376–378 Somewhat surprisingly, in extensively 
drug-resistant tuberculosis, which by definition includes resistance to 
quinolones, the presence of moxifloxacin in the treatment regimen was 
associated with 40% higher favorable outcomes in a meta-analysis.379
Because of widespread quinolone use for respiratory and other 
indications, there have been concerns about selection of resistance and 
masking of symptoms in undiagnosed tuberculosis patients, particularly 
in areas of high endemicity. Prior quinolone exposure for longer than 
10 days has been associated with a sevenfold increased risk of quinolone 
resistance in M. tuberculosis  isolates and a 17-fold increased risk if the 
exposure was greater than 60 days before the diagnosis of tuberculosis.380 
In a randomized trial of patients in Hong Kong with community-acquired 
pneumonia or exacerbations of bronchiectasis, 4.8% of those treated 
with amoxicillin-clavulanate were diagnosed with active tuberculosis 
within 12 months, in contrast to 2.4% of those treated with moxifloxacin 
for 5 days and 0% of those treated for 10 days, suggesting potential 
masking by moxifloxacin.381 In an open-label, randomized controlled 
trial of patients with tuberculous meningitis, a levofloxacin-containing 
(10 mg/kg up to 500 mg) regimen produced better survival that a 
rifampin-containing (10 mg/kg up to 450 mg) regimen, both in combina -
tion with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and prednisolone, but 
the levofloxacin-containing regimen was associated with significantly 
more seizures and myoclonus.382 In a subsequent study, however, addition 
of levofloxacin to a standard four-drug regimen containing rifampin 
did not result in improved outcomes and was also associated with an 
increased occurrence of seizures.383
For nontuberculous mycobacteria, ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice daily 
or 500 mg three times daily) has been used in three-drug (clarithromycin 
plus amikacin)384 and four-drug (rifampin, ethambutol, and clofazi -
mine)385 regimens in patients with AIDS and M. avium-intracellulare  
complex bacteremia. Improvement in symptoms occurred with both 
regimens, but clearance of bacteremia appeared better with the 
clarithromycin-containing three-drug regimen.386 In cutaneous M. 
fortuitum  infections, ciprofloxacin used alone was followed by relapse 
and the development of drug resistance,143 but ofloxacin has been used 
successfully in some sternotomy infections caused by this pathogen.387 
With agents used against M. leprae,  there have been reports of clinical 
improvement in patients with lepromatous leprosy given ofloxacin 
(400 mg once daily) and pefloxacin (800 mg once daily),388 and in a 
randomized, double-blind study of patients with paucibacillary leprosy, 
at 10 years follow-up, ofloxacin (400 mg once daily) plus rifampin

Mediterranean spotted fever caused by Rickettsia conorii  and Q fever 
caused by Coxiella burnetii  may respond to ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin, 
but doxycycline remains the preferred therapy.419,434,435 Attempts to treat 
patients with brucellosis with quinolones have been complicated by a 
high frequency of relapses,344,436 but a combination of ofloxacin (400 mg 
once daily) and rifampin (600 mg once daily) for 6 weeks resulted in 
a low relapse rate and was comparable to doxycycline plus rifampin.437 
Patients with falciparum malaria have had inconsistent responses to 
quinolones.438,439 Ciprofloxacin decreased the BK polyomavirus load in 
patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplanta -
tion.439,440 A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study of 
levofloxacin 500 mg daily as prophylaxis for BK polyomavirus following 
renal transplant in 154 patients did not find a statistically significant 
difference in the percentage of patients with viremia at a median of 46 
weeks; however, no patient in either group developed BK polyomavirus 
nephropathy.441 Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole alone or together have 
been used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly 
Crohn’s disease, but studies using ciprofloxacin have not shown consistent 
benefit.442
PROBLEMS WITH QUINOLONE 
RESISTANCE DURING CLINICAL USE
Resistance to fluoroquinolones has been found in many locales through -
out the world, but the extent varies in different areas and varies with 
the pathogen and site of infection.443 In addition to data from clinical 
trials, clinical decisions on choice of fluoroquinolones in initial empirical 
therapy would be best informed initially by local susceptibility data 
and later by specific susceptibility data on the patient’s strain. Develop -
ment of bacterial resistance among pathogens during clinical use of 
quinolones is multifactorial. Because spontaneous chromosomal 
resistance mutations causing resistance increments of fourfold to eightfold 
for fluoroquinolones may occur at frequencies of 10−8 to 10−10, resistance 
is predicted to occur more often in settings in which there are large 
numbers of bacteria at the site of infection and the concentration of 
the drug is below the MIC of the least drug-susceptible mutant subpopula -
tion (a value called the mutant prevention concentration).31,444,445 
Therefore, resistance is more likely in infections caused by less susceptible 
pathogens, such as P . aeruginosa  and S. aureus,  at sites of infection 
where the bacterial burden is high or at which drug delivery or host 
eradication mechanisms may be compromised, and in patients who 
receive inadequate drug doses. Once selected, the rate of amplification 
of the drug-resistant mutant population will be governed by the degree 
of resistance conferred by the mutation to the drug being used, the 
fitness cost that bearing the mutation exacts, the dose of the drug being 
used, and the duration of treatment.446
Epidemiologic factors also affect the extent to which resistant 
pathogens can spread and thereby amplify the prevalence of resistance.447 
General surveys of resistance patterns occurring over time have found 
resistance to increase after the introduction of fluoroquinolones and 
to occur most often with Pseudomonas  spp. and staphylococci and in 
soft tissue infections and infections associated with foreign bodies.448–450 
In many medical centers, ciprofloxacin resistance has increased markedly 
(to <90%) among MRSA but not MSSA strains.366,451,452 Resistance appears 
to have been selected in patients colonized with MRSA and given 
ciprofloxacin for other infections.366 Clonal dissemination may also 
contribute to spread of resistance during outbreaks. The community-
acquired MRSA strains that have spread into health care systems are 
more likely ciprofloxacin susceptible, but resistance has occurred in 
some isolates.453,454 Susceptibility rates have also decreased among 
coagulase-negative staphylococci.455 A similar difference between 
methicillin-resistant and -susceptible strains has been seen for cipro -
floxacin resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci, and in this 
setting, cross-selection by exposure to other antibiotics, in addition to 
direct quinolone selection, appears to augment ciprofloxacin resistance 
in methicillin-resistant strains, which are usually also multidrug 
resistant.456,457
More surprising has been the emergence of substantial quinolone 
resistance in initially highly susceptible species of bacteria, particularly 
N. gonorrhoeae, C. jejuni,  and E. coli.  Fluoroquinolone resistance in N. addition, breakthrough bacteremias with quinolone-resistant E. coli  
have occurred as well with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis.411–413 IDSA 
guidelines recommend prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin 
(the latter preferred in patients with increased risk of mucositis-related 
streptococcal bacteremia) in high-risk patients, defined as having an 
expected absolute neutrophil count less than or equal to 100 cells/mm3 
for greater than or equal to 7 days.400 Relative to historical controls, 
levofloxacin (10 mg/kg twice daily) reduced febrile episodes in pediatric 
patients with neutropenia and autologous hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation.414 Reductions in numbers of patients with blood cultures 
yielding gram-negative bacteria was offset by increases in numbers with 
blood cultures yielding gram-positive bacteria. Patients who have received 
quinolone prophylaxis should not be treated with quinolones for fever 
and neutropenia because of the risk of quinolone resistance.
There is limited experience in using quinolones for treatment of 
endocarditis.415 One study reported good responses in intravenous drug 
abusers with right-sided S. aureus  (methicillin-susceptible) endocarditis 
and who complied with the full course of ciprofloxacin (300 mg IV 
twice daily for 1 week, then 750 mg PO twice daily for 3 weeks), plus 
rifampin (300 mg PO twice daily for 4 weeks).416 An additional study 
compared 28 days of inpatient therapy with ciprofloxacin (750 mg PO 
twice daily) plus rifampin (300 mg PO twice daily) versus intravenous 
oxacillin or vancomycin plus gentamicin (given for the first 5 days) for 
similar patients, with similar response rates for the two regimens when 
patients were evaluated at 6 to 7 days after completion of therapy.417 
Drug resistance, however, has occurred in this setting, and there have 
been failures in patients with left-sided S. aureus  endocarditis. Because 
of limited case report data, it is not clear if quinolones, such as levo -
floxacin and moxifloxacin, which would be preferred based on greater 
activity against susceptible strains of S. aureus,  would have better 
outcomes of treatment. There have been a number of single-case reports 
of patients with gram-negative bacillary endocarditis whose infections 
have been suppressed with oral quinolones, but there have been failures. 
Q fever endocarditis, which responds poorly to conventional antimicrobial 
therapy, has been successfully cured with prolonged courses of cipro -
floxacin (12 weeks)418 or ofloxacin plus doxycycline (4 years).419 Doxy -
cycline combined with hydroxychloroquine was, however, superior to 
ofloxacin plus doxycycline.419 Use of quinolones for endocarditis should 
currently be limited to circumstances in which established therapies 
are not possible.
Quinolones vary in their penetration across the blood-brain barrier 
into CSF .420 In the presence of meningeal inflammation, concentrations 
in CSF have reached as high as 39%, 40%, and 60% of peak serum 
concentrations for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and pefloxacin, respec -
tively.421,422 In two small studies of patients with predominantly gram-
negative bacillary meningitis, pefloxacin (800 mg IV every 12 hours) 
cured 12 of 16 neurosurgical patients, many of whom had failed to 
respond to β-lactam therapies,423 and ciprofloxacin (200 mg IV every 
12 hours) cured 18 of 20 similar patients.424 Ten of 12 neonates with 
gram-negative bacillary meningitis (and in some cases mixed infections) 
were also reported to have been cured with intravenous ciprofloxacin 
(10 to 60 mg/kg/day).425 Treatment of P . aeruginosa  meningitis with 
ciprofloxacin may require very high doses in some patients (800 mg 
every 8 hours).426 Use of these quinolones for treatment of meningitis 
should only be considered in those circumstances in which standard 
therapies are not possible or have failed. Ciprofloxacin has been used 
successfully in the treatment of brain abscess caused by S. enterica  
serovar Enteritidis in a small number of case reports.420 For eradication 
of nasopharyngeal carriage of Neisseria meningitidis,  which is indicated 
in the setting of close contact with patients with meningococcal men -
ingitis, ciprofloxacin (750 mg) or ofloxacin (400 mg) given as a single 
dose has been highly effective,427,428 and ciprofloxacin had efficacy similar 
to rifampin (600 mg twice daily for 2 days) and ceftriaxone (2 g IM).429 
The recent emergence of quinolone-resistant strains of N. meningitidis,  
however, could compromise the efficacy of quinolones for this 
indication.430
Quinolones have been used for treatment of a variety of other 
infections in small numbers of patients. A few patients with tularemia 
have responded to ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin,431,432 and several patients 
with cat-scratch disease improved more rapidly after ciprofloxacin

two international, epidemic, multidrug-resistant clones (France9V-3 
and Spain23F-1), raising concerns of possible future spread. In the 
United States, between 1999–2000 and 2001–2002, in one survey, there 
was a twofold increase in the rate of ciprofloxacin (1.2%–2.7%) and 
levofloxacin (0.6%–1.3%) resistance, with a significant minority related 
to widespread quinolone-resistant pneumococcal clones.486 In different 
surveys, which also included invasive and noninvasive strains from 
across the United States, resistance to respiratory quinolones has remained 
consistently low (0.5%–1.1%) since 1996 and through 2004.484,487–490
Several factors potentially account for the variable trends in quinolone 
susceptibilities. Preferential use of quinolones that have better phar -
macokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles against pneumococci relative 
to ciprofloxacin could slow selection of resistant mutants.491,492 In addition, 
introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which targets 
drug-resistant pneumococcal serotypes, may have limited the spread 
of resistant clones. Strains that contain single parC  resistance mutations 
are circulating,493 and these strains, which may be the progenitors of 
fully resistant strains with dual mutations in parC  and gyrA,  would be 
classified as susceptible and thus are difficult to detect with routine 
testing.494 In this background, there is no reason to assume that resistance 
to newer quinolones will not ultimately emerge among S. pneumoniae.484 
Because children are a major reservoir of pneumococci, concerns have 
been raised that possible future increased use of quinolones in children 
could increase the rate of development of resistance to quinolones in 
S. pneumoniae.495
Resistance to quinolones should be monitored, and strategies for 
minimizing its occurrence, including focused quinolone use, should 
be used to avoid compromising the future utility of the class. Prevention 
of emergence of resistance needs to be addressed in several ways, 
including monitoring of preexisting chromosomal and transferable 
mechanisms of resistance; better defining the optimal selected quinolone, 
dosage, and duration of treatment for particular infections; and infection 
control to prevent spread of resistant organisms.445,446,496,497
ADVERSE EFFECTS
The tolerability of the fluoroquinolones is best assessed in double-blind, 
randomized trials in which the effects of patient populations, methods 
of ascertainment, and possible bias can be controlled. In some cases, 
however, such trials may not have the power to detect adverse effects 
occurring at low frequency or in more diverse patient populations. In 
an analysis of 56 such trials, in which fluoroquinolones were compared 
with placebo or other antimicrobial agents, most studies found similar 
adverse effect profiles.498 In a minority of studies, there were either 
significantly fewer or more adverse effects relative to a variety of compara -
tor agents. In a number of instances, increasing doses and durations of 
therapy were associated with higher rates of adverse effects. The overall 
adverse effect profile has been recently reviewed.499
The most frequent category of adverse effect involves the gastro-
intestinal tract, occurring in 3% to 17% of patients in clinical trials. In 
most patients, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort are 
mild when they occur. Diarrhea is less frequent, and antibiotic-associated 
colitis has been rare, possibly because most current quinolones have 
limited effect on the anaerobic bowel flora.498,500 Fluoroquinolone use 
has, however, been a strong epidemiologic risk factor for Clostridioides 
difficile  (formerly Clostridium difficile )–associated diarrhea in some 
studies and was particularly noted in outbreaks of the NAP1 strain, 
which is resistant to fluoroquinolones.501
The next most frequent category of adverse effects involves the nervous 
system, occurring in 0.9% to 11% of patients.502 Symptoms of mild 
headache and dizziness have predominated, followed by insomnia and 
alterations in mood. Hallucinations, delirium, psychosis, and seizures 
are rare.503 Seizures may have resulted in some cases from theophylline 
accumulation or from the ability of theophylline and NSAIDs to augment 
the ability of quinolones to displace GABA from its receptors.504 
Postmarketing surveillance has also identified uncommon cases of 
exacerbations of myasthenia gravis occurring after 0.5 to 10 days (median, 
1 day) of exposure to various quinolones. The effect is usually reversible 
within 24 hours of stopping therapy and has recurred with rechallenge.505 
An increased risk (relative risk, 1.83) of peripheral neuropathy was seen 
in a case-control study of men ages 45 to 80 years. The onset can be gonorrhoeae  was first identified in the 1990s in some countries in the 
Far East.458 The first fluoroquinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae  isolate 
was found in the United States in 1991. Data from a national sentinel 
surveillance system showed that fluoroquinolone resistance increased 
from 0.4% in 1999 to 4.1% in 2003 and to 13.8% in 2006 ( www.cdc.gov/
std/gisp2006/GISPSurvSupp2006Short.pdf ).459 Reduced susceptibility 
of N. gonorrhoeae  to ciprofloxacin was associated with increased 
likelihood of failure with ciprofloxacin treatment.460–462 Subsequently, 
in 2007, the CDC changed its guidance and recommended that fluo -
roquinolones no longer be used as empirical treatment of gonococcal 
infections.173 Quinolone resistance has now also been reported in  
N. meningitidis.430
Resistance emerged in C. jejuni  in human and poultry populations in 
parallel after quinolone use in both groups in Europe.463 In the United 
States, travel to Spain or Latin America was a risk factor for acquiring 
resistant C. jejuni,  and the occurrence of domestically acquired cases in 
patients without prior treatment with a fluoroquinolone also increased. 
Strain typing has shown an overlap in resistant C. jejuni  strains from 
humans and poultry, and contamination of food products with resistant 
C. jejuni  has been demonstrated,464 suggesting contaminated poultry 
products as the source of some resistant infections in humans. Resistance 
acquired by an initially susceptible isolate of C. jejuni  during treatment of 
Campylobacter  gastroenteritis with a quinolone has also been reported.214
Quinolone-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae have emerged 
among inpatients and outpatients in the United States465 and globally, 
in association with fluoroquinolone use.466,467 Hospital-wide fluoroqui -
nolone use correlated with resistance among E. coli, K. pneumoniae,  
and Proteus mirabilis.465,468 Risk factors in Spanish patients with resistant 
E. coli  urinary isolates have included use of quinolones, complicated 
infections, and use of urinary catheters.469 Clinically important resistance 
in E. coli  has also developed in some hematology-oncology units in 
Europe in which quinolones were used as prophylaxis during periods 
of neutropenia470–472 as well as in nonneutropenic patients in Spain.473 
In these units, breakthrough bacteremias with quinolone-resistant E. 
coli have become problems. These bacteremias as well as colonization 
of the fecal flora with quinolone-resistant E. coli474 have been associated 
with quinolone use as prophylaxis and were caused by distinct strains, 
rather than representing clonal spread within the units. In addition, 
some patients not receiving quinolones were found to be colonized 
with quinolone-resistant E. coli,474 and a survey suggested that 25% of 
the population in Spain may have fecal colonization with such strains.475 
These findings, in conjunction with earlier findings of high rates of 
colonization of poultry with resistant E. coli  in Spain,476 raise the pos -
sibility that contamination of the food supply with resistant E. coli  could 
be a contributing factor in these areas.477 Surprisingly, in the United 
States, fluoroquinolone resistance in extraintestinal E. coli  isolates has 
been linked to a clonal lineage with distinctive mutant alleles of gyrA  
and parC.478 Quinolone resistance in E. coli  bloodstream isolates has 
been linked with a higher likelihood of initial inappropriate therapy479 
and, in some studies, higher mortality.480
With increasing use of quinolones for treatment of patients with 
respiratory tract infections, there have been concerns about the emergence 
of quinolone resistance in S. pneumoniae.  In Canada, ciprofloxacin 
resistance in isolates of S. pneumoniae  was 0%, 0.6%, 1.7%, and 4.2% 
in 1993, 1997–1998, 2000–2001, and 2005, respectively,481 with the 
increase between 1993 and 1997–1998 preceded by increasing use of 
quinolones, largely ciprofloxacin. Resistance to levofloxacin and moxi -
floxacin also increased significantly, from 0.2% and 0% between 1997 
and 1998 to 1.1% and 1.0% in 2005, respectively.482 Rates of resistance 
to ciprofloxacin of 15.2% in Northern Ireland and 5.3% in Spain457 have 
also been reported. In 2000 in Hong Kong, rates of resistance to cip -
rofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin were as high as 17.8%, 13.3%, 
and 8.9%, respectively.483 Resistant isolates were generally reported in 
adults but not children, who would be less likely to have received a 
quinolone, and in noninvasive diseases.482–484 Although resistant isolates 
in Hong Kong were clonal, indicating spread from person to person, 
in Canada, increased genetic homogeneity of resistant clones, as well 
as de novo mutations, were associated with quinolone resistance,481–485 
and in Spain, the strains were polyclonal. Worrisome was the observation 
that among the Spanish isolates, 30% of the strains belonged to one of

nationwide, registry-based cohort study in Denmark, however, failed 
to find such an association; neither current nor recent or past fluoro -
quinolone use was associated with a significantly increased risk of retinal 
detachment.526 In a propensity-adjusted, case-control study from Taiwan, 
fluoroquinolone use was associated with aortic aneurysm or dissection 
with an odds ratio of 2.43 for current use and 1.48 for use within 60 
days prior.527 Risk increased with age over 70 years and increased duration 
of exposure. A cohort study of Canadian patients over the age of 65 
years found an adjusted hazards ratio of 2.24 for aortic aneurysm in 
patients receiving concurrent fluoroquinolones, with a substantially 
lower risk for amoxicillin.528 Potential confounding and possible use 
triggered by symptoms of the condition itself add uncertainty as to any 
causal relationship with fluoroquinolone use.
Quinolones, to varying extents, can block the potassium channels and 
thereby delay repolarization in cardiac tissue, an effect that underlies their 
ability to prolong the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. Prolongation 
of the QT interval can predispose to ventricular arrhythmias such as 
torsades de pointes.529 Older quinolones, sparfloxacin and grepafloxacin, 
which had QT interval prolongation greater than that of currently avail -
able quinolones, were removed from the market in part because of reports 
of unexpected cardiac events.529 QT interval prolongation of a lesser 
magnitude was also found with moxifloxacin, and some increased risk of 
arrhythmias have been noted in some530 but not all531 population-based 
studies. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin have lesser effects on prolonga -
tion of the QT interval than moxifloxacin.532–534 Delafloxacin appears to 
produce no QT interval prolongation. Additive effects on QT interval 
prolongation may occur when quinolones are given together with other 
agents that prolong the QT interval. Thus quinolones should be avoided 
or used with caution in patients also receiving class III (block potassium 
channel, e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) or class IA (block potassium and 
sodium channels, e.g., quinidine, procainamide) antiarrhythmics, or 
other agents (e.g., erythromycin) that prolong the QT interval. Risk is 
also potentially increased in the presence of cardiomyopathy, bradycardia, 
hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.534,535
Leukopenia and eosinophilia generally occur in less than 1% of 
patients, and mild elevations in serum transaminases occur in less than 
1% to 3% of patients receiving quinolones; these abnormalities are rarely 
of sufficient severity to require cessation of therapy. An exception occurred 
with trovafloxacin, which was associated with elevated transaminases 
in approximately 10% of patients receiving a 4-week course for prostatitis. 
After release of trovafloxacin for clinical use, rare cases of idiosyncratic, 
symptomatic hepatitis (1:17,000 reporting incidence) were identified 
in postmarketing surveillance, some of which were associated with 
eosinophilic infiltrates and sufficiently severe to cause hepatic failure 
requiring liver transplantation.498,536 These events led to the restrictions 
of trovafloxacin use and later to its withdrawal. Temafloxacin was found 
through postmarketing surveillance to be associated with rare cases of 
hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure at a reporting 
incidence of 1 in 5000; such occurrences led to its removal from the 
market.537 These severe toxic effects of trovafloxacin and temafloxacin 
are of uncertain mechanism and have not been seen with currently 
available quinolones. In a population-based, case-control study of 
outpatients over age 65 years without a history of prior liver disease, 
moxifloxacin (adjusted odds ratio, 2.0) and levofloxacin (adjusted odds 
ratio, 1.85), but not ciprofloxacin, were associated with an increased 
risk of hospital admission for acute liver injury within 30 days of receiving 
a prescription relative to clarithromycin.538
Although there have been occasional reports of hypoglycemia 
associated with the use of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin, 
cases of severe hypoglycemia associated with use of gatifloxacin in 
diabetics on oral hypoglycemic agents and other patients have occurred.539 
In addition, hyperglycemia has been reported in elderly nondiabetics 
receiving gatifloxacin. Various quinolones have been shown to stimulate 
release of insulin from rat pancreatic islet cells. Although the frequency 
of dysglycemia appears to be low overall, the relative risk was greater 
with gatifloxacin than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin.540,541 Although 
systemic gatifloxacin has been withdrawn from the market, topical 
ophthalmic formulations are still available and have not been associated 
with dysglycemia.542rapid and resolution variable. The US Food and Drug Administration 
reissued in 2016 a class warning regarding fluoroquinolone peripheral 
neuropathy because of additional reports since the 2004 warning that 
in some cases neuropathy appeared to be permanent. No patient-specific 
risk factors have been identified, and the mechanism is not known.506 
Although the incidence was very low (1 in 20,000), another case-control 
study found an increased risk of pseudotumor cerebri in patients receiving 
fluoroquinolones within 15 to 30 days (adjusted rate ratio, 5.7).507
Allergic and skin reactions have occurred in 0.4% to 2.8% of patients 
in clinical trials overall. Unspecified rashes have been most frequent. 
With gemifloxacin, rashes developed in 2.8% of patients in clinical 
trials, but in young women receiving gemifloxacin for 7 or more days, 
a self-limited, maculopapular rash without biopsy evidence of vasculitis 
occurred in 14%.508 In patients with durations of therapy of 5 or less 
days, rash occurred with low frequency, similar to that of other fluo -
roquinolones. The occurrence of a rash with gemifloxacin resulted in 
a somewhat higher rate of rash in response to subsequently given 
ciprofloxacin (5.9%) relative to placebo (2.0%).509 Hypersensitivity 
cross-reactivity among different fluoroquinolones can vary and is difficult 
to predict,510 with, for example, reports of patients with prior reactions 
to moxifloxacin tolerating ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin but not vice 
versa. Phototoxicity reactions are uncommon with currently used 
quinolones but can occur in some patients after exposure to ultraviolet 
A (320–400 nm) light. Earlier quinolones with a halide at position 8, 
which are no longer available, had higher rates of phototoxicity.511,512 
Delafloxacin appears to have little or no phototoxicity. Drug fever, 
urticaria, angioedema, vasculitis, serum sickness–like syndromes, and 
anaphylactoid reactions have been uncommon. Acute interstitial nephritis, 
probably allergic in origin, also occurs infrequently and has been 
associated with eosinophiluria but generally not crystalluria. Infiltrates 
of lymphocytes and eosinophils have been found in the renal interstitium 
on renal biopsies.498
Arthropathy with cartilage erosions and noninflammatory effusions 
occurs in the weight-bearing joints of juvenile animals given quino -
lones.513 Experience with use of quinolones in children has increased, 
particularly in children with cystic fibrosis given ciprofloxacin.514 These 
children and others receiving nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin 
have only uncommonly had joint symptoms, which have been revers -
ible.514,515 Studies to identify subclinical cartilage damage by nuclear 
magnetic resonance imaging of joints of treated children have also been 
negative.516 Because of concerns about cartilage toxicity in children, 
quinolones have not been recommended for routine pediatric use, but 
there is an evolving view, based on absence of human arthropathy seen 
over the past decades of fluoroquinolone use, that in some children, 
particularly those with cystic fibrosis, the benefit of quinolones outweighs 
what appears to be a small short-term risk of joint toxicity, and expanded 
use of quinolones in pediatrics is under consideration.514,517
Tendinitis with acute onset of pain, swelling, and inflammatory skin 
changes has been reported in adults given various quinolones518,519 and 
has resulted in a highlighted warning in drug safety labeling in the 
United States. The Achilles tendon is most often involved, and rupture 
can occur. Symptom onset can be after completion of quinolone therapy. 
The risks are highest in patients older than 60 years, patients on  
corticosteroids, and organ transplant recipients.519–521 In a large patient 
database, fluoroquinolone use was associated with Achilles tendinopathy 
(odds ratio, 4.3) and rupture (odds ratio, 2.0).522 In addition to age and 
steroid use, female sex and being nonobese were also risk factors. The 
mechanism of this toxicity is uncertain, but exposure of cultured tendon 
cells to ciprofloxacin has been associated with increases in expression 
of matrix metalloproteinases and cellular apoptosis.523
Associations with other potential connective tissue toxicities have 
been reported but cause-and-effect relationships have not been estab -
lished. Recent large cohort studies show conflicting results with respect 
to an association of retinal detachment and fluoroquinolone use. In a 
study of patients who had visited an ophthalmologist in British Columbia, 
Canada, current use of fluoroquinolones was associated with a 4.5-fold 
higher risk of developing a retinal detachment, whereas no risk was 
observed among recent users and past users, and the absolute risk was 
low.524 In a study from Taiwan, patients who received oral fluoroqui -
nolones within the preceding 90 days had a twofold higher risk for

antibiotics, there were no differences in birth defects, spontane -
ous abortions, prematurity, or fetal distress, but there was a higher 
rate of therapeutic abortions, suggesting that concerns about 
teratogenic risks may exceed the actual risks.544 Because quinolones 
can be excreted in breast milk, they should be avoided for nursing  
mothers.Safety in pregnancy498 has not been established for any of the qui -
nolones, but studies of babies born to women exposed to norfloxacin 
or ciprofloxacin during the first trimester identified no increase in 
major malformations, stillbirths, or premature births.543–545 In one 
prospective case-control study comparing 200 women exposed to 
fluoroquinolones and 200 women exposed to known nonembryotoxic

Part I  Basic Principles in the Diagnosis and Management of Infectious DiseasesUPDATE
December 5, 2020
In 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a class warning regarding 
fluoroquinolone use, which was noted to have an increased risk of aortic aneurysm 
or dissection. The background population risk of aneurysm or dissection is low  
(9 per 100,000 people per year), however in multiple studies, the rates in fluoro -
quinolone-treated patients were double that of controls.1,2,3 As such, the FDA recom -
mends avoiding prescribing fluoroquinolones to patients with aortic aneurysms and 
in patients at higher risk such as those with peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, 
Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, as well as elderly patients in cases in 
which other treatment options are available.4References
