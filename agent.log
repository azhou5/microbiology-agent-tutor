The bacterium can enter the body through wounds, especially deep puncture wounds, which may occur from stepping on a rusty nail or similar objects. \n\nRusty metal itself is not inherently dangerous, but it is often found in environments where *Clostridium tetani* may be present. Therefore, the risk is associated with the potential for the bacteria to be introduced into the body through a wound. Preventive measures include proper wound cleaning and tetanus vaccination, which provides immunity against the toxin produced by *Clostridium tetani*.
