Ms. Emily Tran is a 32-year-old female who works as a software developer and has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and mild asthma. She presents to the clinic with a 5-day history of increasing discomfort and itching in the vaginal area, accompanied by a thick, white, odorless discharge. Emily reports that the symptoms began shortly after completing a course of antibiotics for a recent sinus infection. She denies any fever, abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms but mentions that the itching has become quite bothersome, especially at night. Emily is sexually active with one partner and uses oral contraceptives for birth control. She has tried over-the-counter antifungal creams with minimal relief and is concerned about the persistence of her symptoms.
