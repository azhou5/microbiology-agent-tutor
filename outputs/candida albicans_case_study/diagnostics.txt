Initial laboratory tests for Emily reveal a complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 7,500/μL, hemoglobin at 13.5 g/dL, and platelets at 280,000/μL, all within normal limits. The basic metabolic panel shows normal electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzymes. Inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are not elevated, consistent with the absence of systemic infection or inflammation. A urinalysis is unremarkable, with no signs of infection or hematuria.

Given the clinical presentation, imaging studies are not immediately indicated, as the symptoms are localized to the vaginal area and there is no suspicion of deeper or systemic involvement. Therefore, no X-rays or CT scans are performed at this time.

Microbiological analysis of the vaginal discharge is conducted. A Gram stain of the discharge reveals numerous budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae, consistent with Candida species. A culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar grows smooth, creamy white colonies typical of Candida albicans. Further identification is confirmed using a germ tube test, which is positive, indicating Candida albicans. For additional confirmation, a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis is performed, which accurately identifies the organism as Candida albicans. Antifungal susceptibility testing shows sensitivity to fluconazole, clotrimazole, and nystatin, guiding appropriate antifungal therapy.
