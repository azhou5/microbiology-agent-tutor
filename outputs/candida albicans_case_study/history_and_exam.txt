Emily has a past medical history significant for recurrent urinary tract infections, for which she has been treated with multiple courses of antibiotics over the past few years. She also has mild asthma, managed with an as-needed albuterol inhaler. Her current medications include an oral contraceptive pill and a daily multivitamin. She has no known drug allergies. Emily is a non-smoker, consumes alcohol socially, and denies any illicit drug use. She lives with her partner in an urban apartment and works long hours, often under stress, which she manages with regular yoga sessions. There is no significant family history of immunodeficiency or chronic illnesses. Recently, she completed a 10-day course of amoxicillin for a sinus infection, which she suspects might have triggered her current symptoms.

On physical examination, Emily appears well-nourished and in no acute distress. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6Â°F, blood pressure 118/76 mmHg, heart rate 72 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The abdominal examination is unremarkable, with no tenderness or organomegaly. A pelvic examination reveals erythematous and edematous vulvar tissues with excoriations due to scratching. There is a thick, white, curd-like discharge adherent to the vaginal walls, consistent with a yeast infection. The cervix appears normal, and there is no cervical motion tenderness. A wet mount preparation of the discharge shows budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae, confirming the suspicion of a Candida albicans infection.
