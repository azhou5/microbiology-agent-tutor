Emily is diagnosed with vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by Candida albicans. This diagnosis is supported by her clinical presentation of vulvar itching and discharge, the findings on pelvic examination, and the microbiological confirmation of Candida albicans from the vaginal discharge.

The treatment plan involves initiating antifungal therapy with fluconazole, given its efficacy and Emily's sensitivity profile. She is prescribed a single oral dose of fluconazole 150 mg, which is typically effective for uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. Emily is advised to monitor her symptoms and return for follow-up if there is no improvement within three days or if symptoms recur. She is also counseled on preventive measures, such as avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use and maintaining good genital hygiene, to reduce the risk of recurrence. Additionally, Emily is encouraged to discuss any persistent symptoms with her healthcare provider, as recurrent infections may require a longer course of treatment or alternative therapies. Regular follow-up appointments are recommended to monitor her response to treatment and address any concerns she may have.
