1. What is the significance of the mild leukocytosis and left shift in Emily Carter's white blood cell count, and how does this relate to the pathophysiology of an Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection?
2. How does the presence of fecal leukocytes and occult blood in stool studies help differentiate between different types of diarrheal illnesses, and what does this indicate about the underlying inflammatory process in Emily's case?
3. Considering Emily's mild hypokalemia, what pathophysiological mechanisms in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infections contribute to electrolyte imbalances, and how should these be managed?
4. Why is it important to confirm the presence of Shiga toxin genes in the stool sample, and how does this finding influence the clinical management and potential complications of Emily's infection?
5. Given the antimicrobial susceptibility results, why is antibiotic therapy generally not recommended for Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections, and what are the potential risks associated with such treatment?
