Case
Mrs. Emily Carter is a 32-year-old female who works as a chef at a popular farm-to-table restaurant. She has no significant past medical history and is generally in good health. Emily presents to the urgent care clinic with a 2-day history of severe abdominal cramping and watery diarrhea, which has recently become bloody. She reports feeling increasingly fatigued and has experienced nausea but no vomiting. Emily mentions that several of her coworkers have also been feeling unwell, and she recalls preparing a large batch of fresh salads using locally sourced produce two days ago. She denies any recent travel or antibiotic use. Concerned about the severity and persistence of her symptoms, Emily seeks medical attention to determine the cause and receive appropriate treatment.

Emily Carter has no significant past medical history and is not currently taking any medications. She has no known drug allergies. As a chef, she frequently handles raw produce and meats, which may increase her exposure to foodborne pathogens. Emily lives alone and reports a social history of occasional alcohol consumption but denies smoking or illicit drug use. She has not traveled recently and has not been in contact with anyone known to be ill outside of her workplace. Her recent preparation of salads using locally sourced produce, which was consumed by her and her coworkers, is a relevant epidemiological factor, especially given the symptoms she and her colleagues are experiencing.

On physical examination, Emily appears moderately ill and slightly dehydrated. Her vital signs reveal a temperature of 100.4°F, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, heart rate of 98 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness, particularly in the lower quadrants, but no rebound tenderness or guarding is noted. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. There is no hepatosplenomegaly, and the rest of the physical examination, including cardiovascular and respiratory systems, is unremarkable. Her skin turgor is slightly decreased, consistent with mild dehydration. These findings, along with her history, suggest a possible enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection, likely related to the consumption of contaminated produce.

Initial laboratory tests for Emily Carter reveal a white blood cell count of 12,500/μL with a slight left shift, indicating a mild inflammatory response. Her hemoglobin is 13.5 g/dL, and platelet count is 220,000/μL, both within normal limits. The basic metabolic panel shows mild hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.2 mmol/L, likely due to gastrointestinal losses, and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 18 mg/dL with a creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, indicating normal renal function. C-reactive protein is mildly elevated at 8 mg/dL, consistent with inflammation. Stool studies are significant for the presence of fecal leukocytes and occult blood, supporting an inflammatory diarrhea process.

Abdominal ultrasound is performed to rule out other causes of abdominal pain and shows no evidence of appendicitis or other acute abdominal pathology. The bowel loops appear mildly distended, consistent with increased bowel activity, but there are no signs of obstruction or perforation.

Microbiological analysis of the stool sample is crucial. A stool culture grows Escherichia coli O157:H7, confirmed by serotyping. Further testing with a multiplex PCR assay detects the presence of Shiga toxin genes, confirming the diagnosis of enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing shows that the isolate is sensitive to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, although antibiotic therapy is generally not recommended for EHEC due to the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). These findings, combined with her clinical presentation and epidemiological link to contaminated produce, confirm the diagnosis of an E. coli O157:H7 infection.

Emily Carter is diagnosed with hemorrhagic colitis caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7, a serotype known for producing Shiga toxin, which can lead to severe gastrointestinal symptoms and potential complications such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This diagnosis is supported by her clinical presentation of bloody diarrhea, the epidemiological link to contaminated produce, and microbiological confirmation of the pathogen.

The primary treatment plan focuses on supportive care, as antibiotic therapy is generally contraindicated in EHEC infections due to the risk of precipitating HUS. Emily is advised to maintain adequate hydration to compensate for fluid losses due to diarrhea. Oral rehydration solutions are recommended to correct her mild dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, particularly her hypokalemia. She is instructed to consume small, frequent sips of fluids and to avoid anti-motility agents, which could exacerbate her condition.

Monitoring includes regular assessment of her hydration status, electrolyte levels, and renal function to detect any early signs of HUS, such as decreased urine output or hemolytic anemia. Emily is advised to seek immediate medical attention if she experiences symptoms suggestive of HUS, such as reduced urination, pallor, or increased fatigue. Follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor her recovery and ensure resolution of symptoms. Additionally, public health authorities are notified to investigate the potential outbreak source and prevent further cases. Emily is counseled on safe food handling practices to reduce the risk of future infections.

Key Concepts
- **Microbiological Characteristics**: Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a serotype of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) known for producing Shiga toxin, which can cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms and complications like hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).

- **Pathophysiology**: The Shiga toxin produced by E. coli O157:H7 disrupts the intestinal lining, leading to bloody diarrhea and potential systemic effects, such as kidney damage in HUS.

- **Diagnostic Approaches**: Diagnosis of EHEC involves stool culture and serotyping to identify E. coli O157:H7, along with PCR assays to detect Shiga toxin genes, confirming the presence of the pathogen.

- **Treatment Principles**: Management of EHEC infections primarily involves supportive care, including hydration and electrolyte management, as antibiotics are contraindicated due to the risk of precipitating HUS.

- **Complication Monitoring**: Patients with EHEC should be closely monitored for signs of HUS, such as decreased urine output and hemolytic anemia, requiring immediate medical intervention if these symptoms develop.

- **Prevention Strategies**: Preventive measures include proper food handling and hygiene practices, especially in food service settings, to reduce the risk of contamination and transmission of EHEC.

- **Public Health Considerations**: In cases of EHEC outbreaks, public health authorities should be notified to trace the source and implement measures to prevent further cases, highlighting the importance of epidemiological surveillance.
