Initial laboratory tests for Emily Carter reveal a white blood cell count of 12,500/μL with a slight left shift, indicating a mild inflammatory response. Her hemoglobin is 13.5 g/dL, and platelet count is 220,000/μL, both within normal limits. The basic metabolic panel shows mild hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.2 mmol/L, likely due to gastrointestinal losses, and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 18 mg/dL with a creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, indicating normal renal function. C-reactive protein is mildly elevated at 8 mg/dL, consistent with inflammation. Stool studies are significant for the presence of fecal leukocytes and occult blood, supporting an inflammatory diarrhea process.

Abdominal ultrasound is performed to rule out other causes of abdominal pain and shows no evidence of appendicitis or other acute abdominal pathology. The bowel loops appear mildly distended, consistent with increased bowel activity, but there are no signs of obstruction or perforation.

Microbiological analysis of the stool sample is crucial. A stool culture grows Escherichia coli O157:H7, confirmed by serotyping. Further testing with a multiplex PCR assay detects the presence of Shiga toxin genes, confirming the diagnosis of enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing shows that the isolate is sensitive to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, although antibiotic therapy is generally not recommended for EHEC due to the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). These findings, combined with her clinical presentation and epidemiological link to contaminated produce, confirm the diagnosis of an E. coli O157:H7 infection.
