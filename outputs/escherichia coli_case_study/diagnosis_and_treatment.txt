Emily Carter is diagnosed with hemorrhagic colitis caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7, a serotype known for producing Shiga toxin, which can lead to severe gastrointestinal symptoms and potential complications such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This diagnosis is supported by her clinical presentation of bloody diarrhea, the epidemiological link to contaminated produce, and microbiological confirmation of the pathogen.

The primary treatment plan focuses on supportive care, as antibiotic therapy is generally contraindicated in EHEC infections due to the risk of precipitating HUS. Emily is advised to maintain adequate hydration to compensate for fluid losses due to diarrhea. Oral rehydration solutions are recommended to correct her mild dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, particularly her hypokalemia. She is instructed to consume small, frequent sips of fluids and to avoid anti-motility agents, which could exacerbate her condition.

Monitoring includes regular assessment of her hydration status, electrolyte levels, and renal function to detect any early signs of HUS, such as decreased urine output or hemolytic anemia. Emily is advised to seek immediate medical attention if she experiences symptoms suggestive of HUS, such as reduced urination, pallor, or increased fatigue. Follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor her recovery and ensure resolution of symptoms. Additionally, public health authorities are notified to investigate the potential outbreak source and prevent further cases. Emily is counseled on safe food handling practices to reduce the risk of future infections.
