2. Considering Emily's symptoms and the epidemiological link to locally sourced produce, what factors in the food supply chain could contribute to the transmission of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli?
3. Given Emily's demographic profile and the nature of her work, how does the epidemiology of Escherichia coli infections in food industry workers compare to the general population?
4. How do host factors such as age, immune status, and gastrointestinal health influence the clinical presentation and severity of Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections?
5. In managing Emily's case, what considerations should be made regarding the use of antibiotics, and how might her clinical presentation guide the decision-making process?
