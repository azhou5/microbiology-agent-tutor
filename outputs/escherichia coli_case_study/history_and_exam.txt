Emily Carter has no significant past medical history and is not currently taking any medications. She has no known drug allergies. As a chef, she frequently handles raw produce and meats, which may increase her exposure to foodborne pathogens. Emily lives alone and reports a social history of occasional alcohol consumption but denies smoking or illicit drug use. She has not traveled recently and has not been in contact with anyone known to be ill outside of her workplace. Her recent preparation of salads using locally sourced produce, which was consumed by her and her coworkers, is a relevant epidemiological factor, especially given the symptoms she and her colleagues are experiencing.

On physical examination, Emily appears moderately ill and slightly dehydrated. Her vital signs reveal a temperature of 100.4Â°F, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, heart rate of 98 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness, particularly in the lower quadrants, but no rebound tenderness or guarding is noted. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. There is no hepatosplenomegaly, and the rest of the physical examination, including cardiovascular and respiratory systems, is unremarkable. Her skin turgor is slightly decreased, consistent with mild dehydration. These findings, along with her history, suggest a possible enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection, likely related to the consumption of contaminated produce.
