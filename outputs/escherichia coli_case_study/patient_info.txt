Mrs. Emily Carter is a 32-year-old female who works as a chef at a popular farm-to-table restaurant. She has no significant past medical history and is generally in good health. Emily presents to the urgent care clinic with a 2-day history of severe abdominal cramping and watery diarrhea, which has recently become bloody. She reports feeling increasingly fatigued and has experienced nausea but no vomiting. Emily mentions that several of her coworkers have also been feeling unwell, and she recalls preparing a large batch of fresh salads using locally sourced produce two days ago. She denies any recent travel or antibiotic use. Concerned about the severity and persistence of her symptoms, Emily seeks medical attention to determine the cause and receive appropriate treatment.
