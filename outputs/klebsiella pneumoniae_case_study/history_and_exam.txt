Mr. Thompson has a significant medical history that includes chronic alcohol use, which he estimates to be about 4-5 drinks daily for the past 30 years, and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, diagnosed 10 years ago. He has been non-compliant with his diabetes management, often missing doses of his prescribed metformin and insulin due to his irregular work schedule. He has no known drug allergies. Socially, he lives alone and spends most of his time on the road, often eating at truck stops, which contributes to his poor dietary habits. He is a former smoker, having quit 5 years ago after a 40 pack-year history. There is no significant family history of respiratory or infectious diseases. Epidemiologically, his occupation as a long-haul truck driver exposes him to various environments and potential infectious agents, particularly in crowded settings.

On physical examination, Mr. Thompson appears acutely ill and is visibly diaphoretic. His vital signs reveal a temperature of 102.8Â°F, blood pressure of 95/60 mmHg, heart rate of 115 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89% on room air. He is tachypneic and using accessory muscles to breathe. Auscultation of the chest reveals decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion over the right upper lobe, with bronchial breath sounds and egophony present. There is also notable crackling in the same area. His cough is productive of thick, blood-tinged sputum. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable, with no signs of peripheral edema or jugular venous distention. His skin is warm to touch, and there are no rashes or lesions. Given his presentation, there is a high suspicion of a severe bacterial pneumonia, likely due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, considering his risk factors and the characteristic "currant jelly" sputum.
