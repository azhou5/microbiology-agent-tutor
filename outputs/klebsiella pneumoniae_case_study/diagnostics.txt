Initial laboratory tests for Mr. Thompson reveal a white blood cell count of 18,500/μL with 90% neutrophils, indicating a significant leukocytosis with a left shift. Hemoglobin is slightly low at 11 g/dL, and platelets are within normal limits at 230,000/μL. His basic metabolic panel shows elevated blood glucose at 250 mg/dL, consistent with his poorly controlled diabetes, and a slightly elevated creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, suggesting possible dehydration or early renal impairment. C-reactive protein is markedly elevated at 20 mg/dL, and procalcitonin is also elevated, supporting a bacterial infection. Liver function tests are within normal limits, despite his history of alcohol use.

A chest X-ray reveals dense consolidation in the right upper lobe with a bulging fissure sign, characteristic of lobar pneumonia. There is no significant pleural effusion noted. A subsequent CT scan of the chest confirms the presence of a large area of consolidation in the right upper lobe with possible early abscess formation, but no evidence of cavitation at this stage.

Microbiological analysis of the sputum shows numerous neutrophils and gram-negative bacilli on Gram stain. Sputum culture grows Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is confirmed by molecular testing. Blood cultures are also positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2 out of 2 sets, indicating bacteremia. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing reveals the organism is sensitive to ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam, and meropenem, but resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate. The hypermucoviscous phenotype is confirmed by a positive string test, correlating with the invasive nature of the strain. These findings are consistent with a severe Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia, complicated by bacteremia, necessitating prompt and aggressive antimicrobial therapy.
