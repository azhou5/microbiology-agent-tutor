Ms. Rodriguez is diagnosed with influenza-associated meningitis caused by the H3N2 strain of the influenza virus. This diagnosis is supported by her clinical presentation, the presence of a maculopapular rash, neurological symptoms, and the confirmation of influenza virus RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid via PCR testing. Given the sensitivity of the virus to oseltamivir, the treatment plan includes initiating oral oseltamivir at a dose of 75 mg twice daily for a duration of 5 days. 

In addition to antiviral therapy, supportive care is crucial. Ms. Rodriguez is advised to maintain adequate hydration and rest. Analgesics such as acetaminophen are recommended to manage fever and headache. Monitoring of her neurological status is essential, and she should be observed for any signs of worsening symptoms, such as increased headache severity, confusion, or new neurological deficits, which would necessitate further evaluation.

Follow-up is scheduled in 48 hours to assess her response to treatment and to ensure symptom resolution. Ms. Rodriguez is also advised to remain off work until she is afebrile for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretics, to prevent further spread of the infection within the hospital. Additionally, her colleagues are encouraged to seek medical evaluation if they develop similar symptoms, and infection control measures are reinforced in her workplace to manage the potential outbreak.
