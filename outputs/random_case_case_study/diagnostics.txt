Initial laboratory tests for Ms. Rodriguez reveal a white blood cell count of 12,500/μL with a differential showing 70% lymphocytes, indicating a possible viral infection. Her hemoglobin is 13 g/dL, and platelet count is 220,000/μL. The basic metabolic panel is within normal limits, but her C-reactive protein is elevated at 20 mg/L, suggesting significant inflammation. Liver function tests are normal, and renal function is preserved. Given her symptoms and occupational exposure, further testing is warranted to identify the causative agent.

A chest X-ray is performed to rule out any respiratory involvement, which shows clear lung fields without any signs of consolidation or effusion. Due to her neurological symptoms, a CT scan of the head is conducted, which reveals no acute intracranial abnormalities, ruling out any structural causes for her headache and neck stiffness.

Microbiological investigations include a viral panel from a nasopharyngeal swab, which is positive for the influenza virus, specifically the H3N2 strain, consistent with the circulating strain in the hospital setting. Blood cultures are negative, and a lumbar puncture is performed to assess for viral meningitis, with cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing elevated protein and lymphocytic pleocytosis, but no bacterial growth. PCR testing of the CSF confirms the presence of influenza virus RNA, supporting the diagnosis of influenza-associated meningitis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not applicable as this is a viral infection, but antiviral susceptibility testing indicates sensitivity to oseltamivir, guiding appropriate antiviral therapy.
