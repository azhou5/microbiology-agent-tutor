Ms. Rodriguez has no significant past medical history and is not currently taking any medications. She has no known drug allergies. Her social history reveals that she lives alone and has a pet cat. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs. As a nurse, she has regular contact with patients, including those with infectious diseases, which is a relevant epidemiological factor given her current symptoms and the potential for nosocomial infections. She has not traveled recently and has not been in contact with anyone known to have a contagious illness outside of her workplace.

On physical examination, Ms. Rodriguez appears fatigued and mildly distressed. Her vital signs are notable for a temperature of 102.5Â°F, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Examination of her skin reveals a maculopapular rash on her trunk and arms. Her conjunctivae are clear, and there is no evidence of jaundice. Cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia but is otherwise unremarkable. Respiratory examination is normal, with clear breath sounds bilaterally. Abdominal examination shows no tenderness or organomegaly. Neurological examination is significant for mild photophobia and neck stiffness, but no focal neurological deficits are noted. These findings, combined with her occupational exposure, suggest a possible viral infection, potentially linked to an outbreak in her hospital setting.
