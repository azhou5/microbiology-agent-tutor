1. What is the significance of the elevated lymphocyte count in Ms. Rodriguez's white blood cell differential, and how does it correlate with the pathophysiology of a viral infection like influenza?
2. How does the elevated C-reactive protein level in Ms. Rodriguez's laboratory findings reflect the inflammatory response in viral infections, and what does it indicate about the severity of her condition?
3. Considering the cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing elevated protein and lymphocytic pleocytosis, what pathophysiological processes are likely occurring in the context of influenza-associated meningitis?
4. How do the normal liver and renal function tests influence the choice and dosing of antiviral therapy in Ms. Rodriguez's case, and why is this important for her management?
5. Given the negative blood cultures and positive PCR for influenza virus RNA in the CSF, what does this suggest about the route of infection and the appropriateness of antiviral versus antibacterial treatment?
