Mrs. Thompson is a 62-year-old female who works as a librarian and has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, for which she has been receiving immunosuppressive therapy. She presents to the clinic with a 5-day history of worsening pain and swelling in her left knee, accompanied by fever and chills. She reports that the knee pain began as a mild discomfort but has progressively intensified, making it difficult for her to walk or stand for long periods. She also notes that the skin over her knee has become red and warm to the touch. Mrs. Thompson mentions that she had a minor scrape on her knee about a week ago while gardening, which she initially dismissed as inconsequential. Given her immunosuppressive treatment and the recent skin injury, there is a concern for a possible staphylococcal infection, potentially involving Staphylococcus aureus, which is known for causing both superficial and deep-seated infections, including septic arthritis.
