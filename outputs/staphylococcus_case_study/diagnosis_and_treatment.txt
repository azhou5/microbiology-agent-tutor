The diagnosis of septic arthritis in Mrs. Thompson is confirmed, caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). This diagnosis is supported by the clinical presentation of knee pain, swelling, and fever, along with laboratory findings of elevated inflammatory markers and synovial fluid analysis showing gram-positive cocci in clusters. The synovial fluid culture growing MSSA further corroborates the diagnosis.

The treatment plan involves initiating intravenous antibiotic therapy with cefazolin at a dose of 2 grams every 8 hours, given the organism's susceptibility profile. This regimen is chosen for its efficacy against MSSA and will be continued for a total of 4 to 6 weeks, depending on clinical response and follow-up evaluations. In addition to antibiotics, Mrs. Thompson will undergo joint aspiration to relieve pressure and remove purulent material, which may need to be repeated if significant effusion persists. 

Supportive care includes pain management with acetaminophen and careful monitoring of her renal function due to the mild elevation in creatinine. Her immunosuppressive therapy will be reviewed, and methotrexate may be temporarily withheld to allow for better infection control, with close coordination with her rheumatologist. 

Regular monitoring of inflammatory markers, renal function, and clinical symptoms will guide the duration of intravenous therapy. Transition to oral antibiotics, such as cephalexin, may be considered once she shows significant clinical improvement and is afebrile for at least 48 hours. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess joint function and ensure resolution of the infection, with physical therapy introduced as needed to restore mobility and strength in the affected knee.
