Mrs. Thompson has a significant medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, for which she has been on long-term immunosuppressive therapy, including methotrexate and low-dose prednisone. She denies any known drug allergies. Her social history reveals that she lives alone and is an avid gardener, which she finds therapeutic. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. There is no recent travel history, and she has not been in contact with anyone known to be ill. Her immunosuppressive state and recent skin injury while gardening are notable risk factors for a staphylococcal infection, particularly given her exposure to soil and potential skin flora.

On physical examination, Mrs. Thompson appears mildly distressed due to pain. Her vital signs show a temperature of 101.8Â°F, blood pressure of 130/78 mmHg, heart rate of 98 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The left knee is visibly swollen, with erythema extending approximately 5 cm beyond the patella. The area is warm to the touch and exquisitely tender, with a limited range of motion due to pain. There is no evidence of fluctuance or purulent discharge. The rest of the musculoskeletal examination is unremarkable, with no other joints showing signs of active inflammation. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits. Given these findings, the clinical picture is highly suggestive of septic arthritis, likely due to Staphylococcus aureus, necessitating further diagnostic workup and prompt intervention.
