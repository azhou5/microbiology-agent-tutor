Initial laboratory tests for Mrs. Thompson reveal a white blood cell count of 16,500/μL with 88% neutrophils, indicating a significant leukocytosis with a left shift. Hemoglobin is 11.2 g/dL, and platelets are 320,000/μL. Inflammatory markers are markedly elevated, with a C-reactive protein level of 18 mg/dL and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 65 mm/hr. The basic metabolic panel is within normal limits, except for a mild elevation in creatinine at 1.3 mg/dL, likely due to dehydration from fever.

An X-ray of the left knee shows soft tissue swelling but no bony abnormalities or joint effusion. To further evaluate the joint, an ultrasound is performed, revealing a moderate effusion in the left knee joint, consistent with synovitis. This finding prompts an arthrocentesis, which yields cloudy synovial fluid. The synovial fluid analysis shows a white blood cell count of 75,000/μL with 90% neutrophils, confirming a septic process.

Microbiological studies are crucial for definitive diagnosis. Gram stain of the synovial fluid shows numerous neutrophils and gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggestive of Staphylococcus species. Synovial fluid cultures grow Staphylococcus aureus within 24 hours. Further testing with a coagulase test confirms the presence of Staphylococcus aureus. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing reveals that the isolate is methicillin-sensitive (MSSA), showing susceptibility to oxacillin, cefazolin, and vancomycin, but resistance to penicillin. Blood cultures taken at the time of admission are negative, likely due to the localized nature of the infection and prior antibiotic exposure.

These findings confirm the diagnosis of septic arthritis due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, necessitating targeted antibiotic therapy and possible surgical intervention to prevent joint damage.
