Maria's medical history reveals no significant past illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations. She is up to date on vaccinations, including influenza and tetanus. She does not take any regular medications and denies any known allergies, including to medications or environmental factors. Maria's social history includes her occupation as a nurse, which exposes her to various infectious agents and potential pathogens. She reports moderate alcohol consumption, occasionally having a glass of wine with dinner, and is a non-smoker. She exercises regularly, participating in yoga and jogging to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Maria denies any recent travel outside the city and recalls no recent contacts with sick individuals outside her workplace. Epidemiologically, her exposure to nosocomial environments is a significant risk factor for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), especially given her proximity to patients with infected wounds and invasive devices.

During the physical examination, Maria appears visibly uncomfortable and fatigued. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 101.5Â°F, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 96 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Inspecting her left forearm reveals a 3 cm erythematous area surrounded by induration, with a central puncture wound that is exuding purulent discharge. The surrounding skin is warm and firm to the touch, indicating cellulitis. No lymphangitic streaking is visible. Upon palpation, the area is highly tender, eliciting a grimace from Maria. No axillary lymphadenopathy is present, and the range of motion in her arm and hand remains unaffected. Her skin appears otherwise healthy, without other lesions or areas of concern. The remainder of the examination and systemic reviews, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal, are unremarkable. Maria's nasal carriage is assessed, but nasal swabs were not performed during this initial examination. Given the clinical findings and occupational exposure, focusing on potential MRSA is prudent as further diagnostics and management are considered.
