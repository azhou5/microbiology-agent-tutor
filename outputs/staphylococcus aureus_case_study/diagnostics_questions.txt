1. What does the significantly elevated white blood cell count with a predominance of neutrophils suggest about the type of infection Maria is experiencing, and how does this correlate with the typical immune response to Staphylococcus aureus?
2. Given Maria's elevated C-reactive protein level, what pathophysiological processes are likely responsible for this marked increase, and how does it help in assessing the severity of her infection?
3. In the context of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), why might blood cultures be a critical step in the diagnostic process, and how could they influence Maria's management plan?
4. How does the identification of the mecA gene through molecular PCR testing impact the therapeutic approach in managing MRSA infections, particularly in regards to antibiotic resistance?
5. With antimicrobial susceptibility results in hand, what factors should be considered when selecting vancomycin, linezolid, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Maria's treatment, and how do these decisions relate to specific laboratory findings?
