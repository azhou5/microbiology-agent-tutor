1. How might Maria's occupation as a nurse in a high-turnover hospital predispose her to contracting a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection?
2. Considering Maria's case and the epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus, what role does nasal carriage play in increasing the risk of developing an infection, particularly in healthcare settings?
3. What are the potential host factors related to Maria's lifestyle and occupational exposure that could influence the severity and progression of her MRSA cellulitis?
4. How do the demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, and occupation of Maria, correlate with the trends seen in staphylococcal infections, especially in nosocomial settings?
5. Given Maria's clinical presentation, what are the implications of methicillin resistance in her treatment plan and what factors should be considered in tailoring her management strategy?
