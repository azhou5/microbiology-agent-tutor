Ms. Maria Gomez is a 32-year-old female who works as a nurse in a busy urban hospital known for its high patient turnover and frequent nosocomial infections. She has no significant medical history, but given her occupation, she is frequently exposed to various infectious pathogens. Maria presents to the urgent care clinic with a 4-day history of worsening pain and redness around a small wound on her left forearm. She reports that the wound initially appeared insignificant, merely a minor scratch likely incurred during a hurried shift, but it has since become swollen and notably warm to the touch. Over the past 48 hours, she has developed a fever, chills, and malaise, feeling increasingly fatigued and finding it difficult to perform her daily duties. Additionally, Maria mentions that she feels a throbbing sensation within the area, along with occasional purulent discharge. Being acutely aware of her clinical surroundings and the potential risks, Maria is concerned about the possibility of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) given its prevalence in healthcare settings. She seeks immediate evaluation and treatment, worried that her symptoms could be indicative of a staphylococcal skin infection escalating into a more systemic issue.
