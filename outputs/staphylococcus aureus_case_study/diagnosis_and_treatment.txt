Maria Gomez is diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cellulitis, based on her clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and microbiological culture results. The infection, originating from an occupationally acquired minor skin breach, has resulted in localized cellulitis with systemic inflammatory response features, evidenced by her fever and elevated white blood cell count.

The treatment plan includes starting on intravenous vancomycin, due to its established efficacy against MRSA and Maria's systemic symptoms. The dosing is 15 mg/kg every 12 hours, adjusted based on her renal function and trough levels to maintain therapeutic concentrations while minimizing toxicity. Given her generally stable vital signs and no indication of bacteremia, she is managed as an outpatient with a daily return for infusions, monitored closely for clinical improvement and any adverse drug effects. Comprehensive wound care is also instituted, with the area being cleaned and covered with sterile dressings to prevent further contamination. The purulent discharge is gently removed and, as her condition warrants, consultations with a wound care specialist are considered.

Non-pharmacological measures include rest, elevation of the affected limb to reduce swelling, and adherence to strict hygiene measures, both to facilitate healing and prevent transmission of MRSA to others. Standard contact precautions are recommended while she continues to work in a healthcare setting. Maria is advised to avoid direct contact with patients until her infection is appropriately controlled.

Follow-up involves regular assessments of her clinical status, wound healing progress, and laboratory parameters, particularly vancomycin levels. An outpatient clinic evaluation is scheduled after 72 hours to determine the infectionâ€™s response to therapy and consider transitioning to oral antibiotics such as linezolid or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole upon symptomatic improvement and normalization of inflammatory markers. Comprehensive education about this specific pathogen, including potential carriage sites like her nasal passages, is provided, alongside lifestyle advice to reduce the risk of future infections. Maria is encouraged to return for immediate evaluation should symptoms worsen or new systemic signs develop, ensuring prompt intervention to prevent complications.
