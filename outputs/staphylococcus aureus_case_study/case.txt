Case
Ms. Maria Gomez is a 32-year-old female who works as a nurse in a busy urban hospital known for its high patient turnover and frequent nosocomial infections. She has no significant medical history, but given her occupation, she is frequently exposed to various infectious pathogens. Maria presents to the urgent care clinic with a 4-day history of worsening pain and redness around a small wound on her left forearm. She reports that the wound initially appeared insignificant, merely a minor scratch likely incurred during a hurried shift, but it has since become swollen and notably warm to the touch. Over the past 48 hours, she has developed a fever, chills, and malaise, feeling increasingly fatigued and finding it difficult to perform her daily duties. Additionally, Maria mentions that she feels a throbbing sensation within the area, along with occasional purulent discharge. Being acutely aware of her clinical surroundings and the potential risks, Maria is concerned about the possibility of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) given its prevalence in healthcare settings. She seeks immediate evaluation and treatment, worried that her symptoms could be indicative of a staphylococcal skin infection escalating into a more systemic issue.

Maria's medical history reveals no significant past illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations. She is up to date on vaccinations, including influenza and tetanus. She does not take any regular medications and denies any known allergies, including to medications or environmental factors. Maria's social history includes her occupation as a nurse, which exposes her to various infectious agents and potential pathogens. She reports moderate alcohol consumption, occasionally having a glass of wine with dinner, and is a non-smoker. She exercises regularly, participating in yoga and jogging to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Maria denies any recent travel outside the city and recalls no recent contacts with sick individuals outside her workplace. Epidemiologically, her exposure to nosocomial environments is a significant risk factor for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), especially given her proximity to patients with infected wounds and invasive devices.

During the physical examination, Maria appears visibly uncomfortable and fatigued. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 101.5°F, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 96 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Inspecting her left forearm reveals a 3 cm erythematous area surrounded by induration, with a central puncture wound that is exuding purulent discharge. The surrounding skin is warm and firm to the touch, indicating cellulitis. No lymphangitic streaking is visible. Upon palpation, the area is highly tender, eliciting a grimace from Maria. No axillary lymphadenopathy is present, and the range of motion in her arm and hand remains unaffected. Her skin appears otherwise healthy, without other lesions or areas of concern. The remainder of the examination and systemic reviews, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal, are unremarkable. Maria's nasal carriage is assessed, but nasal swabs were not performed during this initial examination. Given the clinical findings and occupational exposure, focusing on potential MRSA is prudent as further diagnostics and management are considered.

Maria's laboratory results show a complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 17,500/μL, predominantly neutrophilic with 80% segmented neutrophils, indicative of a bacterial infection. Her hemoglobin and platelet counts are within normal ranges at 12 g/dL and 280,000/μL, respectively. The basic metabolic panel is unremarkable, with normal electrolyte levels, kidney function, and liver enzyme tests. However, the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein is markedly elevated at 20 mg/dL, confirming significant inflammation. Additionally, blood cultures were taken, as systemic involvement was suspected due to her occupation and clinical presentation.

Imaging involved obtaining an X-ray of Maria’s left forearm to assess for possible deep-seated infection or osteomyelitis. The radiographs reveal significant soft tissue swelling but no evidence of bony involvement, which rules out osteomyelitis at this stage. There is no gas within the soft tissues to suggest necrotizing infection or abscess formation requiring urgent surgical intervention.

Microbiological analysis of the purulent discharge from Maria’s wound shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, consistent with Staphylococcus aureus. Culture results confirm growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), exhibiting resistance to multiple β-lactam antibiotics, including oxacillin and penicillin. Molecular PCR testing of the wound swab identified the mecA gene, characteristic of MRSA, affirming methicillin resistance and aiding in rapid diagnosis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing reveals susceptibility to vancomycin, linezolid, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, offering effective options for antibiotic therapy. Given these findings, Maria's clinical presentation aligns with a diagnosis of MRSA cellulitis, prompting initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial treatment.

Maria Gomez is diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cellulitis, based on her clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and microbiological culture results. The infection, originating from an occupationally acquired minor skin breach, has resulted in localized cellulitis with systemic inflammatory response features, evidenced by her fever and elevated white blood cell count.

The treatment plan includes starting on intravenous vancomycin, due to its established efficacy against MRSA and Maria's systemic symptoms. The dosing is 15 mg/kg every 12 hours, adjusted based on her renal function and trough levels to maintain therapeutic concentrations while minimizing toxicity. Given her generally stable vital signs and no indication of bacteremia, she is managed as an outpatient with a daily return for infusions, monitored closely for clinical improvement and any adverse drug effects. Comprehensive wound care is also instituted, with the area being cleaned and covered with sterile dressings to prevent further contamination. The purulent discharge is gently removed and, as her condition warrants, consultations with a wound care specialist are considered.

Non-pharmacological measures include rest, elevation of the affected limb to reduce swelling, and adherence to strict hygiene measures, both to facilitate healing and prevent transmission of MRSA to others. Standard contact precautions are recommended while she continues to work in a healthcare setting. Maria is advised to avoid direct contact with patients until her infection is appropriately controlled.

Follow-up involves regular assessments of her clinical status, wound healing progress, and laboratory parameters, particularly vancomycin levels. An outpatient clinic evaluation is scheduled after 72 hours to determine the infection’s response to therapy and consider transitioning to oral antibiotics such as linezolid or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole upon symptomatic improvement and normalization of inflammatory markers. Comprehensive education about this specific pathogen, including potential carriage sites like her nasal passages, is provided, alongside lifestyle advice to reduce the risk of future infections. Maria is encouraged to return for immediate evaluation should symptoms worsen or new systemic signs develop, ensuring prompt intervention to prevent complications.
