Maria's laboratory results show a complete blood count with a white blood cell count of 17,500/μL, predominantly neutrophilic with 80% segmented neutrophils, indicative of a bacterial infection. Her hemoglobin and platelet counts are within normal ranges at 12 g/dL and 280,000/μL, respectively. The basic metabolic panel is unremarkable, with normal electrolyte levels, kidney function, and liver enzyme tests. However, the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein is markedly elevated at 20 mg/dL, confirming significant inflammation. Additionally, blood cultures were taken, as systemic involvement was suspected due to her occupation and clinical presentation.

Imaging involved obtaining an X-ray of Maria’s left forearm to assess for possible deep-seated infection or osteomyelitis. The radiographs reveal significant soft tissue swelling but no evidence of bony involvement, which rules out osteomyelitis at this stage. There is no gas within the soft tissues to suggest necrotizing infection or abscess formation requiring urgent surgical intervention.

Microbiological analysis of the purulent discharge from Maria’s wound shows gram-positive cocci in clusters, consistent with Staphylococcus aureus. Culture results confirm growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), exhibiting resistance to multiple β-lactam antibiotics, including oxacillin and penicillin. Molecular PCR testing of the wound swab identified the mecA gene, characteristic of MRSA, affirming methicillin resistance and aiding in rapid diagnosis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing reveals susceptibility to vancomycin, linezolid, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, offering effective options for antibiotic therapy. Given these findings, Maria's clinical presentation aligns with a diagnosis of MRSA cellulitis, prompting initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial treatment.
