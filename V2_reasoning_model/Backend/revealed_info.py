        Your task is to extract and categorize key medical information from a clinical conversation. 
        Organize the information into three categories:
        1. Patient History: symptoms, complaints, timeline, medical history, risk factors, etc.
        2. Physical Examination: vitals, physical findings, observations, etc.
        3. Labs & Tests: lab results, imaging findings, diagnostic tests, etc.
        
        IMPORTANT: Focus on extracting NEW information from the most recent message exchange. 
        Extract only facts and findings that are medically relevant.
        Extract information in discrete, granular items rather than as long paragraphs.
        
        Format your response as a valid JSON object with these three categories as keys, and each entry as a key-value pair within its category.
        Each entry's key should be a brief description of the finding (1-5 words), and the value should be the specific details (5-15 words, concise).
        
        You MUST return a valid, complete JSON object. Do not include any explanations or notes outside the JSON structure.

        For example:
        {
            "history": {
                "Duration of symptoms": "5 days of fever",
                "Main complaint": "Shortness of breath"

                "Temperature": "101.2Â°F",
                "Lung examination": "Crackles in right lower lobe"
            },
            "labs": {
                "White blood cell count": "Elevated at 14,500",
                "Chest X-ray": "Right lower lobe infiltrate"

Previous conversation context (for reference only):
